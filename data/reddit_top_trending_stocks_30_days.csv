wallstreetbets,Big Tech CapEx - AI race continues - Nvidia will benefit bigly,"AI infrastructure spending is accelerating faster than expected, with Microsoft, Google, and Meta massively increasing their CapEx in 2025 to keep up with AI demand.

CapEx Comparison: 2024 vs. 2025:

- MSFT: 55.7B in 2024 to 80B in 2025
- Google: 52.5B in 2024 to 75B in 2025
- Meta: 39B in 2024 to 60B in 2025

AI servers remain bottlenecked. Microsoft & Google can’t build AI data centers fast enough. That's why they couldn't beat expectations in cloud sales this quarter.

CapEx is being funneled into GPUs, networking, and AI-specific chips. This should make NVIDIA the biggest winner of this trend.

Also, OpenAI just introduced a new ""Deep Research"" AI model, designed for long-context reasoning. This will require even more compute power, further straining existing AI infrastructure. More power demand = more GPUs, networking gear, and data centers.

As long as AI models grow in complexity and scale, NVIDIA and AI infrastructure players should benefit. 

Even if Deepseek story was accurate, optimized model like Deepseek's will drive more demand, which will need even more powerful servers.

All the cases for yet another great year for chip makers especially NVIDIA, don't you think?

Position: Around 50k NVDA and 2x leverage NVDL stocks and options.

wallstreetbets,"Guys, GOOG and AMD are releasing earnings today.","I'm re-writing to better along with WSB's rules. Alphabet Inc, the parent company of Google, is scheduled to release its fourth-quarter earnings today, February 4, 2025, after the market closes. Analysts anticipate earnings of $2.13 per share on revenue of $96.7 billion, up from $1.64 per share on $86.3 billion the previous year.

I'm really interested in hearing about the company's substantial investments in artificial intelligence and the performance of its cloud services. They have been integrating its latest AI model (Gemini 2.0) across various products and services.

Google Workspace and Sheets, their AI can now analyze data trends and automatically generating static charts, which can be inserted into spreadsheets Gemini AI is also now embedded within Google Cloud services, offering generative AI tools that enhance creativity and productivity. This integration aids in tasks such as code generation, data analysis, and the development of AI-driven applications. Subscribers to the Google One AI Premium Plan gain access to Gemini Advanced features, including enhanced AI capabilities across Google apps, 2 TB of cloud storage, and other premium services. And of course on Android and Pixel devices, Gemini AI powers features like Expressive Captions, which not only transcribe speech but also capture non-speech elements such as sighs and gasps, providing a more comprehensive understanding of audio content. Their AI is also being integrated into Google Search and the Chrome browser, enhancing the user experience with more intuitive and intelligent features. They claim that this should improve search results, personalized recommendations, and advance browsing capabilities. Maybe.

In the cloud sector, Google Cloud is expected to report a 32% rise in revenue for the fourth quarter, following a 35% increase in the previous quarter. This growth rate surpasses that of competitors like Microsoft's Azure and Amazon Web Services. As of right now the stock has already risen 6.9% this year and 41% over the past twelve months, reflecting investor confidence in the company's strategic direction.

As Alphabet prepares to announce its earnings, I wanna know how the company leverages its AI advancements and cloud services to drive future growth. So with that said, is anyone else playing earnings?

Next, I wanted to talk about AMD. They are set to report its fourth-quarter earnings today, From what I've read, analysts anticipate a 22% year-over-year revenue increase to $7.53 billion, with adjusted earnings per share (EPS) expected to rise to $1.09 from $0.77 in the same period last year. Just like Google, I'm focused on checking out AMD's advancements in artificial intelligence. The company has recently unveiled several AI-centric products, including the 5th Gen AMD EPYC processors and the AMD Instinct MI325X accelerators, aiming to enhance performance in data centers and enterprise applications.

But despite these innovations, AMD faces challenges in the AI chip market, primarily due to Nvidia's dominance and the trend of major tech companies developing custom silicon. Looking online, it looks like analysts are predicting that AMD's revenue from AI chips could reach $10 billion this year, driven by growth in the data center segment.

And in the personal computing sector, AMD has expanded its AI capabilities with the introduction of the Ryzen AI 300 Series processors, featuring up to eight ""Zen 5"" CPU cores and the latest RDNA 3.5 graphics architecture.hese processors aim to deliver enhanced AI performance for consumer and commercial applications.

Similarly to the GOOG call, I will be closely monitoring how the company leverages its AI advancements to drive future growth and compete in the evolving semiconductor landscape. But I'm fairly bearish on AMD.","['AMD', 'MSFT', 'AMZN', 'AMD', 'AMD', 'AMD', 'AMD', 'AMD', 'NVDA', 'AMD', 'AMD', 'AMD']",55,56,40,2025-02-04 20:28:42+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ihrkvn/guys_goog_and_amd_are_releasing_earnings_today/,0.9971

wallstreetbets,I hold both $PLTR Palantir and $BB Blackberry. Why I'm confident Blackberry will be the next Palantir,"Ah yes, I'll say it first, ""oh look, another BlackBerry thread, these always come up once every year and nothing ever happens"" or ""been holding BBags since $15"". Well, I've been holding onto my BBags for 4 years (just as I have with Palantir) - you can check my posting history for receipts - and I'm holding for glory.

Back to the comparison. Once upon a time, Palantir was building an operating system called Foundry that Wallstreet and paperhands collectively decided could be a worthless pipedream and dropped it back to and below it's original DPO price to $6 and change.

Fast forward to today and the stock is $100 and you have Dr. Alex Karp saying this:

***“For the first time people want to partner with us, it used to be partnership meetings where it was a complete waste of time and BS just so they can say they met with us like high school dating for nerds…now, I have real partnership discussions because a lot of these people in verticals have to deliver and are under a lot of pressure and know how good our products are”. - Alex Karp***

\----------------

Now lets compare this to BlackBerry with a short little history lesson. Okay, a super short  history lesson. Forget their phones ever existed - they acquired a company called QNX in 2010 and have since been the de facto **OPERATING SYSTEM** for most cars not named Tesla and are in 24/25 EV's that are becoming increasingly complex and data driven (they also have a significant presence in the growing medical devices field and soon to be robotics field as well, which are gravy on top of the cherry).

Palantir was head banging away 20+ years to get their operating system to be future proof (okay, admittedly I don't know if it actually took them 20 years to develop Foundry, but lets go with that) and similarly, BlackBerry has been doing the same with QNX.

Now lets read a couple quotes from the BlackBerry team about QNX.

Quote #1:  
***The moat -- the competitive moat around this QNX business continues to remain very deep.***

***And to John's point, if anything, we're in a fairly strong position here that OEMs are coming to us and asking us to do more. - Tim Foote, Chief Financial Officer***

Quote #2:  
***Customers are now coming to QNX for its proven safety and security credentials, which are essential in today's market. - John Chen, Former CEO***

\-----------------

Okay, now it's time for you to do some brain work and think this thought through carefully. Do you think an operating system that makes your car and whatever future car(s) you're going to buy (unless you buy a Tesla) functional and is critical for safety, is worth only 3.71 billion dollars?

What if I told you that this operating system could also be the foundation for medical devices that'll keep you alive after your 10th trip to Vegas or Thailand? Or what if I told you that it could be integral to making sure that your robot housemaid isn't stealing your girlfriend/wife/boyfriend?

The TLDR of all of this is:

Would you rather buy a McD's burger for $4 or a single share of an operating system that hasn't yet been discovered as the most secure operating system for cars and in the future, robotics and medical devices?

\------------------

My total dollar amounts invested (attached a screenshot for proof):

$BB:  
Account #1 - $173,644.56 CAD (currently worth $114,615.60 CAD)

I just had my fattest month in the market—$62K in gains—and I’m here to gloat like a Redditor who just discovered options trading.

HIMS: Started with 1,000 shares at $16, rode that chunky telehealth piggy up to $33, took profits, then reloaded with 2,000 shares at $24. Within weeks, turned $48K into $78K. Sold half, still holding 1,000 shares through earnings, because I expect this thing to go so parabolic it’ll need a prescription for high blood pressure.

Netflix? While you nerds were binge-watching Squid Game again, I was making money. Dropped $9K into calls, flipped them for a $19K gain, and trimmed 20 shares out of my 100 to lock in some more profits. All this inside my Roth, except for 700 shares of HIMS and the Netflix calls, because I like to keep some risk where Uncle Sam can’t touch it.

Best play of the year? RIVIAN. Scooped 2,000 shares around $12, and this thing is gearing up like a Tesla owner explaining why gas is a scam.

wallstreetbets,Why Nvidia (most likely) won't meet the same fate as Cisco during the dotcom bubble,"Previous post was removed for not showing positions. I added them at the bottom.

Since Nvidia's stock price took a hit, I've been seeing a lot of posts and comments comparing Nvidia to Cisco during the peak of the dotcom bubble and claiming that this is where the AI bubble pops, so I decided to write this post to comparing the two companies, how they are different, and why using a sample size of 1 to predict a crash is as regarded as it gets.

This is written from the perspective of someone who worked in tech during the dotcom bubble (still do) and who had direct exposure to the crash. I will try to make it as consise and straight-to-the-point as possible since no one wants to read a book on a reddit post:

1. **Business model**: CSCO's business model was as bad as it gets. They were selling infrastructure hardware that could last you years with little to no need for upgrades. When infrastructure was build, the demand for CSCO's products slowed drastically. NVDA sells compute power, which will always be in demand as long as there's demand for AI, which isn't stopping anytime soon (see next 3 points for why).
2. **Demand**: CSCO's demand came primarily from tech startups with little to no cash (huge vulnerability) whereas NVDA's demand comes primarily from tech giants with more cash than god. Not to mention that CSCO's demand was cyclical and tied to the telecom industry, which was significantly smaller and less competitive than today's tech industry.
3. **Innovation**: Tech giants stand to lose a lot if they don't constantly innovate, which makes underinvesting in AI significantly riskier than overinvesting, as repeated by most big tech CEOs. If one of the tech giants drops out of the AI arms race and the others are able to innovate on it, that one company is done. Losing market share in this ultra-competitive market is as bad as it gets, and significantly worse than losing cash on an investment that might never pan out. The revenue to R&D budget percentage is nearly **triple** now compared to what it was during the dotcom bubble. This is why demand for top-of-the-line hardware will remain strong for the forseeable future.
4. **Moat and competition**: CSCO was overly concentrated on hardware, which opens the door for easy competition. NVDA's moat isn't their hardware, it's CUDA, which was being developed nearly a decade before any competitor even started to think about AI. This is what gave them a huge head-start (that is still nowhere close to being closed) and landed Nvidia where it is today. CUDA makes the costs of switching to a competitor's hardware too expensive to warrant doing so. As Jensen said: ""competition's hardware could be free and it would still be too expensive"".
5. **Ease of investing and PEs**: Higher PEs today can be justified with the fact that investing has become incredibly easier than it was back then and that US stocks have become much more international. Back then you had to phone your broker, pay significant fees sometimes ranging from $50 to $100 (which made growth investing/active trading a lot less appealing than it is today for retail investors) and mail in a check and paperwork. The whole process could take several days/weeks. Online accounts did exist, but they were very rare and payment was still done by mailing or dropping off checks for a while. Now anyone can fund an account and make a trade for next to nothing in fees in a single day **even internationally**. So the fact that CSCO was trading at a PE of 200 at it's peak tells you how absolutely insanely overvalued it was. NVDA is trading at a PE of 47. Peanuts in comparison.
6. **Growth prospects**: CSCO's growth was inflated by speculative demand whereas NVDA’s revenue is tied to measurable AI adoption (e.g., cloud giants spending billions on GPUs). People expected CSCO to grow based on their position in the market. NVDA has actual demand and revenue growth which is proven by TSMC's declared revenue and corraborated by countless giants.

**Bonus note: Why deepseek isn't bearish news for Nvidia** (Completely going under the assumption that they are legit, which seems less likely every day); I'm not going to keep repeating the same copy-paste that's been on this sub for the past few days (Jevons Paradox, more compute means more demands, etc). A lot of people's arguments are based under the impression that the end-goal for AI is to make a chatGPT. It isn't. And even if it was, do you really think that deepseek is the ultimate and final form of chatGPT? What deepseek has done is shown people that startups can compete with giants (at least in regards to LLMs). This means more competition and more GPU sales (even if lower-end). **Competition in AI application is as bullish as it gets for Nvidia**. Giants aren't going to stop buying top-of-the-line GPUs just because someone was able to make a chatGPT using less ressources. This literally makes no sense (refer to point #3 above).

Now I'm not completely discounting the possibility that NVDA might share a fate somewhat similar to CSCO's, but if AI really is a bubble that's going to eventually pop. It still has a long way to run based on the fundamentals and on the points discussed in this post. The upcoming earnings will be a testament to that fact.

**TL;DR**: Nvidia has a better sales model that strongly encourages additional spending and recurrent purchases (Cisco's didn't). Competition between Nvidia's clients is fiercer than Cisco's clients. Revenue to R&D capex ratio is higher than it ever was (triple the dotcom bubble's). Nvidia's moat is in it's software (CUDA), which was being developped long before any competitor even touched AI and makes it extremely difficult for competition to chip away at Nvidia's market dominance. Cisco was too concentrated on hardware which had really poor upgrade incentives and made competition very easy. Cisco's growth was highly speculative whereas Nvidia's growth is real and supported.

The first news of acquisition was heard before the elections. This was step 2. The companies (NVDA and AVGO) preparing for a tighter (🫦) Foreign policy under a Trump administration.

Step 3. Trump won and Republicans hold the majority in the House and Senate.

Step 4. A Cheaper acquisition price needed to be established. No explanation necessary. Intel is down ""Bigly"".

Step 5. Nvidia met with Trump most likely regarding Stargate AND upcoming Tariffs. And Trump stood his ground. Questionable on his part considering his push on AI dominance,  but okay..?

Overall situation is that Nvidia and Broadcom will look to acquire Intel to avoid Tariffs while maintaining profit margins. And will obtain Intel at a steal of a price considering their 18A (1.8nm) process coming to maturity in H2 2025 ahead of TSMC's slightly larger and less advanced 2nm process.

Every other company is just training or experimenting. A big assumption is that Elmo will change regulation to benefit from it for their Robo taxi operation, but the regulation isn’t what is stopping Tesla from becoming a robot taxi company they haven’t proven their tech yet. 

Yes, AI might be something that could be disrupting or changing a lot of Google’s original business. But it’s not like their AI is completely shitty. It’s still amongst the top and they have an ecosystem which can easily leverage this. I suspect Apple losing out on the market because of Apple Intelligence being subpar. Google will end up creating a personal AI because of the amount of personal data it has from all of us. No other company can do that because they just don’t have access to all of this. 

Googles search business was still growing at 10% per year. Even if the number of searches go down because people start using AI, we haven’t seen any meaningful difference in Google usage so in the worst case, I would just assume that this business isn’t growing for my calculation. But its AI would still accelerate Google cloud and YouTube. And the advertisers are not really going to AI company because they haven’t figured out their business yet and for the time being it’s going to be like a subscription based business. 

Apple and Google are still going to benefit because of their ecosystem. It makes harder for anyone to leave them. This hasn’t historically existed in my opinion when we look at other companies like yahoo or IBM.

And the cherry on top is, it’s the most undervalued big tech right now. ","['AAPL', 'AAPL', 'META', 'TSLA', 'AAPL', 'AAPL', 'AAPL']",580,241,159,2025-02-02 22:53:22+00:00,https://i.redd.it/f9kzh2ai2tge1.jpeg,0.9572

wallstreetbets,DD: What is going on with China's recent developments in quantum computing?,"Google [Tianyan-504](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=tianyan-504&t=newext&atb=v452-1&ia=web). Google [Zuchongzhi 3.0](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=tianyan-504&t=newext&atb=v452-1&ia=web). Google it, right now. Who’s reporting this? China is right behind the USA in quantum computing research, and the markets don't seem to have a clue.

TL;DR: Simply put, I believe the markets have not reacted to China’s most recent advancements in quantum computing. China is potentially not as far behind the USA as markets would have you believe. I provide here a commentary of recent market movements, in relation to recent quantum computing news and developments. I follow with a more technical discussion of the significance of China’s advancements, those of US corporations.

Financial disclaimer: While I justify my comments where possible, some of the comments I make in this post are pure speculation. I do not recommend making speculative trades, such as shorting quantum computing, or buying quantum cybersecurity. I am not a financial advisor, and this is not financial advice.

I was astounded to see the latest news dominating the headlines. How did the market not know that China was developing its own language-learning models? I’m a filthy casual, and even I knew about it. It’s been in our news at least [since July](https://www.marktechpost.com/2024/07/20/deepseek-v2-0628-released-an-improved-open-source-version-of-deepseek-v2/), and available for use [since September last year](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/news/news0905). It was pretty fucking good back then, too. And there’s Alibaba’s Qwenchat, Tencent’s HunYuan, among numerous others they haven’t even started talking about yet. What else have they forgotten, in this wild speculative bull run? They probably think the USA is lightyears ahead in quantum computing too. Oh, oh. They do.

Before you go any further, look up [Tianyan-504](https://english.cas.cn/newsroom/cas_media/202412/t20241206_893281.shtml). Look up [Zuchongzhi 3.0](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11924). Google them, right now. They’re right there, massive Chinese developments both announced in December 2024. The Tianyan-504 surpasses 500 qubits, on par with IBM’s latest developments. And Zuchongzhi 3.0 demolishes Google’s earlier Sycamore by all key metrics. Why can’t we find any article produced by any reputable financial sources, that discuss the significance of these achievements? There is essentially zero market news about it. China is right behind the USA in quantum computing research, and the market has no fucking clue.

Check out D-Wave stock prices, for example. Given their business model relies in part on how they contribute to research in the field, they should be negatively impacted by major research developments in competing economies.

This suggests that while Google’s Willow breakthrough rallied quantum computing stocks and Nvidia’s CEO pushed them back down, China’s developments have had zero impact.

How about Quantum Computing Inc (QUBT)? It tells a similar story. Their focus is on fabrication of photonic quantum computing components – and again, providing researchers access to quantum computing technology. It looks like Google’s Willow breakthrough rallied stocks, and Nvidia’s CEO pushed them back down. China’s developments have had zero impact.

How about IBM? News about Google’s Willow pushed their price down some 3%, which makes good sense. Willow’s performace blew that of IBM’s September R2 Heron processor out of the water. Willow is a competitor, but IBM’s position in the market means they are diversified in so much more than just quantum computing. A small bearish reaction makes perfect sense. So when Tianyan-504 reportedly challenged IBM's benchmarks just three days before Willow did, why didn’t the stock price move?

You can look at SkyWater Technologies (SKYT), and at Global Foundries (GFS), and Rigetti (RGTI), Alphabet (GOOGL), Intel (INTC), TSM (TSM), Keysight Technologies (KEYS), and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). Every one of these key companies relevant to advancing quantum computing in the Western World have one thing in common. When China announces their developments, the markets appear to stay still.

There are three possible reasons for this that I have come up with. There may be other reasons as well that I am not aware of, in which case I encourage you to enlighten me.

The first possible reason is as above: The market is generally not aware. It is likely that some players in the market are aware, and this is a simple piece of information that such players will be taking advantage of – they do not have incentive to highlight this knowledge. Furthermore, the market may be uniquely slow to react. Unlike DeepSeek, which we can physically interact with, breaking records in quantum computing research is less tangible, less sensational. Breaking news, markets are irrational.

The second possible reason is simple: China may be lying. I can not find any evidence to support this idea, and China’s past claims about quantum computing, such as those about [Jiuzhang](https://asiatimes.com/2023/10/china-unveils-faster-light-based-quantum-computer/), have been demonstrably true.

The third possible reason is that China’s quantum computers are not as technically advanced as they sound. Originally I wanted to follow with a full technical discussion about the recent history of Chinese Quantum computing, and the merits of Tianyan-504 and Zuchongzhi 3.0 in comparison to western quantum computing efforts. But since I am not a subject matter expert, and I do not have the time to write in full depth. But I will provide a bit more technical information, summarise and provide references to the academic research for relevant breakthrough technologies, so you can read for yourself.

China is fighting to lead the global race in quantum computing, and [the Chinese government has been investing tens of billions of dollars into quantum computing research](https://thequantuminsider.com/2023/04/13/chinese-quantum-companies-and-national-strategy-2023/), alongside the investments of Chinese institutions and corporations.

In 2020 [Jiuzhang, developed at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), was the second quantum computer in the world to achieve quantum supremacy](https://asiatimes.com/2023/10/china-unveils-faster-light-based-quantum-computer/), and the first photonic quantum computer to do so. Since then, the university has gone on to create further models of Jiuzhang, and develop chips with greater qubit lifetime and fidelity.

In April 2024, The Center for Excellence in Quantum Information and Quantum Physics developed their [Xiaohong superconducting chip](https://english.news.cn/20240425/a95b3c190a59486886f4cddc0def31cd/c.html), their most advanced to date, anticipated to reach the chip performance levels of main international cloud-enabled quantum computing platforms such as IBM’s Heron in key performance metrics including qubit lifetime (how long a qubit can hold its quantum state) and readout fidelity (accuracy in extracting information from qubits). I note the market did not appear to react to the Xiaohong chip either.

On the 13^(th) of November 2024,[ IBM announced their Quantum Heron R2](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/blog/qdc-2024), achieving their goal of running quantum circuits with up to 5,000 two-qubit gates, demonstrating advancements in in qubit lifetime and readout fidelity.

On the 6^(th) of December 2024, [Tianyan-504 was announced](https://english.cas.cn/newsroom/cas_media/202412/t20241206_893281.shtml), developed by China Telecom Quantum Group (CTQG) in partnership with the Chinese Academy of Sciences and QuantumCTek Co., Ltd., and, built on the Xiaohong chips. China is now the only country to achieve quantum computational advantage through both photonics and superconducting quantum computing technologies. This quantum computer will be incorporated into their quantum computing cloud platform, and made available for researcher purposes.On the 9^(th) of December, [Google’s Willow was announced](https://blog.google/technology/research/google-willow-quantum-chip/). What makes Willow exceptional, is that it provides a breakthrough solution to quantum computing’s fidelity issue. It exponentially reduces the amount of error while adding more qubits. Presumably Willow can now be scaled further, and I expect to see further developments with adding more qubits now that this challenge has been solved.

Two weeks later, on the 16^(th) of December 2024, an entirely separate research team with the China Telecom Quantum Group (CTQG) in partnership with the Chinese Academy of Sciences and QuantumCTek Co., Ltd. [announced their Zuchongzhi 3.0](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.11924v1#S1). This superconducting quantum computer makes numerous advancements, and demonstrates quantum advantage through speed. It crushes benchmarks set by Google’s older Sycamore - “Compared to Google’s latest experiment, SYC-67 and SYC-70  the classical simulation cost of our 83-qubit, 32-cycle experiment is six orders of magnitude higher.” Though Zuchongzhi 3.0 does not demonstrate the error correction capability that Willow does, their creators have commented that they believe they can replicate the same techniques in a matter of months.

Quantum computing is still twenty years away from being relevant, they say. That gives lots of time for China to catch up. And from what I can understand, China is just one breakthrough away. There are other questions, such as China’s chip manufacturing capabilities, supply chains for components, that I am unable to find good information on. The US is doing what they can politically, through trade regulation, and restricting financial investment in China’s technologies. China already has the [lead in quantum communications, and potentially in quantum sensing](https://itif.org/publications/2024/09/09/how-innovative-is-china-in-quantum/). But China holds one massive advantage: it’s regime. In contrast to the American model, where corporations closely guard their own secrets from eachother, [China is claims they invest 15 billion of dollars into coordinated, cohesive research.](https://itif.org/publications/2024/09/09/how-innovative-is-china-in-quantum/) And it is showing in their results.

Each advancement that China makes in developing its quantum computing capability, ought to remind the market that there is a risk that the lead the US enjoys in quantum computing is being threatened. But look at those google search results again. Outside of technical circles, the western media simply hasn't picked it up. Look at what happened with DeepSeek. I think the markets just don't know. Investors are already anxious about their investments in quantum computing, and are starting to demand returns. Manufacturers are reluctant to scale component production, given the low demand and potential for volatility. So when the market does find out about China’s achievements in quantum computing, what's going to happen?

Let me know what you think.

Nvidia led AI-related stocks in a sharp decline on Monday, pulling the S&P 500 and Nasdaq lower as well. However, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was higher on the day.

wallstreetbets,Intel will skyrocket after earnings today (AGAIN). Here's why,"Intel reports its earnings today after the bell, and I am certain that the price will pump like last time.

I made a post last quarter predicting Intel would go up after earnings. My reasoning for this play was that the CEO at the time (Pat Gelsinger), was very active on X dropping bible quotes every day. You could just see the desperation in his tweets, and on the day he released the earnings report, God saved Intel, and nana smiled from heaven.

But just because Intel got revived, doesn’t take away the fact that Pastor Pat was a trash CEO. So he resigned (got fired) on December 1st and got replaced by these two:

[David, who has been the CFO of Intel since 2022, and Michelle, who I have no fucking clue where she worked prior to becoming co-CEO](https://preview.redd.it/bunyel1q16ge1.png?width=670&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3743dc87784b3e4dccabc00fb6b17691d7f5cc2)

In the past few days I tried using the same sophisticated due diligence model (scrolling their X page), but these two have a whopping combined.... 9 tweets since they became CEOs. They mostly consist of announcements written by their marketing-interns, so not that exciting.

Now look, Michelle seems like a nice lady, but we all know who is really calling the shots at Intel here. Today's earnings report will cover the period from October 1 to December 31. I know, David became CEO on December 2nd, but do you really think Pastor Pat just woke up one day and decided he wanted to step down? No, they had been preparing David for months.

But before I even scrolled through his X page, I saw something that could give all of us degens an edge over the fancy new york algorithmic quant funds:

[bro is a steelers fan](https://preview.redd.it/3bpeofcx16ge1.jpg?width=392&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8f1ca91905e2ea1a7dd44115f22fe4648ea5edc0)

So I did some research, David has been responsible for restructuring the company and shaping a better future so Intel can make a comeback. I would say he has been in charge of Intel for at LEAST 2 months before Pastor Pat resigned.

There is clear research out there suggesting that there's a correlation between the success of your favorite NFL team and your performance in the workplace. What more of a DD do you need when looking at the performance of the Steelers during this period?

wallstreetbets,QQQ up with trash Q1 estimates - puts at open?,"Pulled out of the market yesterday. But a few interesting observations - everybody missed Q1 top line forecasts on growth.

Meta and Tesla crashed on earnings drop due to missing Q1 forecasts before recovering. Microsoft crashed after Q1 forecast released on earnings call.

Microsoft hinted ""data center computing"" execution driving capacity constraints through Q1, mirroring reports of Blackwell chips overheating earlier this year.

Not surprisingly, Deepseek inference cost reduction implications due to MOE approach yet to be factored in; capex estimates seem to be in line with end of year plans.

Apple on deck today. Profitability expected to be good due to efficiency in production, but Q1 forecasted top line also expected to be trash due to China and Apple intelligence failing.

Still a believer in big tech, but current multiples are historically high with interest rates still near historic highs in the near future which implies expectations of meteoric growth. There seems to be hell of a lot of risk in the market for big bets that won't play out for at least 6 months.

wallstreetbets,Considering TSLA Earnings today,"I'm re-writing to better along with WSB's rules. I haven't really made a text post here before but I've seen the type of DD posted here and wanted to put in my own thoughts and get everyone's idea on Tesla's earnings today. I'm not here to suggest plays or talk about Elon's Tweets. Just the raw facts and what people think of the stock.

First off, Tesla is expected to report an adjusted profit of 77 cents per share, with sales at $27.2 billion. That's a step up from last year's 71 cents per share and $25.2 billion in sales. That's pretty good. In Q4 2024, Tesla cranked out approximately 459,000 vehicles and delivered over 495,000. While these are record numbers, they still fell short of the ambitious targets set by the Musk himself. That being said, these are all previous numbers and we need to try to predict today's numbers. With expectations so high, it might be difficult to beat earnings tonight.

We need to address the new administration obviously. They're going to be phasing out EV incentives so Tesla's projected sales might not be as high as we think. Elon has been touting a 20%-30% sales growth for 2025, but with reduced EV demand and competition from China... it might not be realistic.

Tesla might announce advancements in autonomous driving and upcoming product launches to keep the momentum going. A lower-priced EV, updated models, and the potential rollout of Full Self-Driving and robotaxi services are all in the pipeline. If Tesla can pull these off, it might just silence the haters and send the shorts running for cover. However, considering the last 10 years of ""improvements,"" it's highly unlikely.

Now consider what I've written above and the fact that the stock has dropped drastically 5 out of 7 previous earnings. What do you guys think?","['TSLA', 'TSLA', 'TSLA', 'TSLA', 'TSLA', 'TSLA']",24,62,39,2025-01-29 19:08:22+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1id1rk1/considering_tsla_earnings_today/,0.969
wallstreetbets,Let's talk about META's earnings.,"Zuckerberg's earnings are today and I wanted to drop my 2 cents and see if anyone's up to discuss. I'm re-writing to better along with WSB's rules. I recently tried to make a post about Tesla but it was taken down too by an AI bot for being too political? This is my first discussion post so I'm really testing out the waters on this sub. 

Meta Platforms is set to announce its fourth-quarter results after the market closes and from what I've read analysts are predicting earnings of $6.76 per share, up from $5.33 a year ago. Revenue is expected to hit $47.04 billion, marking a 17% increase year-over-year. Right now it seems like people are particularly keen to see how Meta's hefty investments in artificial intelligence are paying off.

Unfortunately for Meta, DeepSeek has been making waves with its R1 model. It's a Chinese competitor that matches the capabilities of models from U.S. giants like OpenAI and Meta but was developed at a fraction of the cost. DeepSeek's success has sent shockwaves through the tech industry, causing significant stock drops for companies like Nvidia. It's pretty common for China to steal proprietary tech and incorporate it into their own creations, but their AI is entirely open source, unlike OpenAI. This would allow American companies to, in turn, take their new research and work with it. For those who don't know, Meta themselves has an Open-Source Strategy. Their Cheif AI Scientist, Yann LeCun isn't sweating it, though. DeepSeek's R1 is open-source, just like Meta's own Llama model, which in turn validates Meta's open-source approach. Collaboration and transparency might be the goal in the AI race. However, people are wondering how such advancements could be made with such a low budget. This puts into question the amount of funding and money that's currently going into AI.

Despite the DeepSeek-induced drop, Meta's stock has shown resilience. Analysts at Citi argue that Meta could actually benefit from DeepSeek's innovations by incorporating them to enhance its own AI tools, potentially leading to more efficient operations and better returns on investment. As Meta prepares to unveil its earnings, everyone wants to see how the company plans to monetize its AI investments and respond to the rising competition from players like DeepSeek. The tech landscape is shifting, and Meta's next moves could set the tone for the industry's future.

But the earning call won't be entirely about AI. They obviously own Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. Advertising remains the cornerstone of Meta's revenue, accounting for approximately 98% of its total income. I believe Meta's significant investments in artificial intelligence have enhanced its advertising capabilities. AI-powered tools like Advantage+ and generative AI enable advertisers to create highly targeted campaigns, leading to increased return on ad spend. The company reported a 7% year-over-year increase in ad impressions and an 11% rise in average ad prices. Over a million businesses utilized Meta's generative AI tools to produce 15 million ads in a single month, resulting in a 7% uplift in conversions.

Meta's platforms continue to see robust user engagement. The company boasts 3.29 billion daily active users, a 5% increase from the previous year. AI-enhanced content recommendations have driven higher engagement, particularly for video content, thereby boosting advertising opportunities. However, Despite these positive indicators, Meta faces several challenges. The company's Reality Labs division, focused on metaverse initiatives, is expected to report a $5 billion loss for Q4, continuing to weigh on overall profitability. Additionally, regulatory scrutiny, such as the European Union’s Digital Markets Act, poses risks to Meta's data-driven advertising model, potentially leading to increased compliance costs and fines. Competition from platforms like TikTok, Google, and Amazon remains intense, with TikTok's popularity among younger users particularly threatening Meta's growth in key demographics. Although Tiktok's impending ban might really help them monopolize the social media industry.

Everything is telling me that earnings will be bullish.

 > Nvidia (NVDA) Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Jensen Huang will deliver the opening keynote at a major consumer electronics show on Monday, with many analysts viewing the event as a potential growth catalyst for the chipmaking giant. 

> **All but one of the 21 analysts covering the company who are tracked by Visible Alpha maintain a “buy” or equivalent rating,** with analysts at Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, and Bernstein recently naming it a ""top pick."" **The consensus price target is about $177,** a roughly 18% premium over the chipmaker’s intraday level Monday.

> Bank of America: “We highlight NVDA’s continued dominance in genAI compute and ecosystem, quickly expanding from the cloud all the way to enterprise and consumers. **Maintain Buy on our top sector pick.”**

> Stifel: “Nvidia's announcements today are significant, but long-tailed. We view these developments as further deepening the company's competitive moat and positioning around potentially multi-billion dollar advancements tied to AI agents, robotics, autonomous vehicles, graphics and PC and edge-device inferences in the coming years.”

> Meanwhile, for Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) analysts, key takeaways from the keynote were the introduction of the new RTX 50-series GPUs, the announcement that Blackwell is now in full production, AI scaling expansion, and expectations that the company’s automotive business could grow to around $5 billion by fiscal 2026.

> Lastly, Wedbush analysts said Huang’s CES speech “felt more like a rock concert vibe than a tech CEO speech.”

> “The overriding message from Jensen was a slew of new AI technology is coming out of Nvidia around robotics, autonomous technology, PCs that will further stretch their enormous technology lead vs. the rest of the semi and Big Tech landscape,” analysts noted.

> “This was a major ""flex the muscles"" moment for Nvidia and Jensen in this AI arms race playing out across the tech ecosystem globally.”

> Morgan Stanley lowered its price target for Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) from $166 to **$152** on Tuesday, citing investor concerns sparked by the release of DeepSeek’s AI model. 

So if 20 out of 21 analysts maintained a “buy” or equivalent rating with a price target of about $177 before CES, Benchmark  and Bank of America reiterated a Buy rating with a $190 price target after CES, and even now Morgan Stanley says it has a price target of $152...

Then why did Wall Street sell NVDA from ~$142 down to ~$118?  

Are we to believe that Wall Street, with all their analysts, researchers, and quants, decided at a drop of a hat to ignore their own price targets and dump what they themselves described as an undervalued stock, or are they seeing something that retail isn't yet pricing in?

> Microsoft’s security researchers in the fall observed individuals they believe may be linked to DeepSeek exfiltrating a large amount of data using the OpenAI application programming interface, or API, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Software developers can pay for a license to use the API to integrate OpenAI’s proprietary artificial intelligence models into their own applications.

> Microsoft, an OpenAI technology partner and its largest investor, notified OpenAI of the activity, the people said. Such activity could violate OpenAI’s terms of service or could indicate the group acted to remove OpenAI’s restrictions on how much data they could obtain, the people said.

> DeepSeek earlier this month released a new open-source artificial intelligence model called R1 that can mimic the way humans reason, upending a market dominated by OpenAI and US rivals such as Google and Meta Platforms Inc. The Chinese upstart said R1 rivaled or outperformed leading US developers’ products on a range of industry benchmarks, including for mathematical tasks and general knowledge — and was built for a fraction of the cost. The potential threat to the US firms’ edge in the industry sent technology stocks tied to AI, including Microsoft, Nvidia Corp., Oracle Corp. and Google parent Alphabet Inc., tumbling on Monday, erasing a total of almost $1 trillion in market value.

> David Sacks, President Donald Trump’s artificial intelligence czar, said Tuesday there’s “substantial evidence” that DeepSeek leaned on the output of OpenAI’s models to help develop its own technology. In an interview with Fox News, Sacks described a technique called distillation whereby one AI model uses the outputs of another for training purposes to develop similar capabilities.

> “There’s substantial evidence that what DeepSeek did here is they distilled knowledge out of OpenAI models and I don’t think OpenAI is very happy about this,” Sacks said, without detailing the evidence.

> In a statement responding to Sacks’ comments, OpenAI didn’t directly address his comments about DeepSeek. “We know PRC based companies — and others — are constantly trying to distill the models of leading US AI companies,” an OpenAI spokesperson said in the statement, referring to the People’s Republic of China. “As the leading builder of AI, we engage in countermeasures to protect our IP, including a careful process for which frontier capabilities to include in released models, and believe as we go forward that it is critically important that we are working closely with the US government to best protect the most capable models from efforts by adversaries and competitors to take US technology.”","['MSFT', 'MSFT', 'MSFT', 'MSFT', 'META', 'MSFT', 'NVDA', 'ORCL']",2362,585,358,2025-01-29 03:16:58+00:00,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-29/microsoft-probing-if-deepseek-linked-group-improperly-obtained-openai-data,0.9848

Deepseek is actually only the catalyst and not the cause. It's the straw that broke the camels back. When is the last time you saw a public company in the top 10 valuation in sp500 have a net margin of over 50%? Never. 

Also the growth projection that is priced it has 2 assumptions:

1. Net margin of 50% (gross margin of over 80%) going forward. 

2. The rate of purchase will increase. Not only will people need to keep buying, they will need to buy more than last year, which saw companies fomo into datacenters. 


It's not that deepseek will cause companies to just stop buying GPUs. It's that companies are not going to buy exponentially more GPUs indefinitely. Especially when they've left so much on the table in terms of software optimizations. 


Even if companies still fomo hard into GPUs and datacenters at the same rate as 2024, NVDA stock will fall, because there's no additional growth. 

If people buy more, but the margins get tighter as apple, meta, google come out with their own chips or tpus, Nividia stock will fall.

wallstreetbets,Upcoming $RCAT 10 Bagger,"Alright gentlemen, keep your eyes open and your buttholes puckered. $RCAT is primed for a colossal spike in the next 1-2 weeks. Let me explain why.

RCAT is THE best-in-market drone tech and drone swarm company. It went on a colossal run starting in October at $3 per share all the way up to $12 per share in November. The catalyst was a contract announcement from the U.S. army on November 19th that RCAT would be the sole provider of drones for the U.S. Army Short Range Reconnaissance Program. If you didn't already know, military contracts with the U.S. government: pay out big, are guaranteed because of a vast bloated warbank, and often get renewals in the future.

Over the next month, the stock stabilized down to $7-8 per share. Then on December 16th, came the announcement that RCAT would be the sole drone provider and partner with Palantir (PLTR). This was a massive deal. Think AI + drone swarms as the next chapter in future military offensive capabilities. This is not speculation about 20 years in the future, this tech is happening right now and it's happening fast. Governments no longer have an appetite for expensive jets and tanks and conventional ground arms. The war in Ukraine has shown the world that drones are cheaper, faster, and more effective on the combat field. And they are far easier to produce in bulk. This is the market that RCAT is about to capture with its PLTR partnership. And that deal skyrocketed the stock to over $14 per share in late December.

Over the next month, the stock stabilized down to $7-8 per share. Then on January 15th, RCAT announced an exclusive partnership deal with Palladyne AI (PDYN) for autonomous object detection and tracking for multi-modal sensors on drone swarms. This brought the stock all the way back up to $12 per share.

*Over the next month, the stock stabilized down to $7-8 per share.* **We are here. <---** Notice a trend? We're in a holding pattern currently where any new announcement will rekindle enthusiasm and send RCAT to the $10+ moon as it consistently has 3 times before.

Now you may have heard of Trump's $500 billion AI initiative that was recently announced. Everyone thinks this is just going to OpenAI and Oracle just for building bigger LLMs. Not even close to the case. Trump's inner circle is extremely buddy buddy with Alex Karp (CEO of PLTR), Ben Wolff (CEO of Palladyne) and also Palmer Luckey (CEO of Anduril), etc. These people are all in the AI defense space and they are all operating high tech defense companies and whispering in the new administration's ears about the future of drone swarms + AI as the best course of action in future military deterrence. Here's the important part: specifically in the next two weeks there is supposed to be a large announcement from the Pentagon and Department of Defense about Trump's projected military strategy. Drone swarm tech is inevitably going to be a huge part of this strategy, and RCAT is in a prime position to get extra government contracts off of this. Once this is announced, it will immediately moon past $10.

The Risk: Deepseek r1 continues to ratfuck the entire U.S. AI market and pseudo-speculative small caps continue to take a dump on our foreheads.

TL;DR: Drones = $$$. AI + Drones = 🚀. Not financial advice.

wallstreetbets,Nvidia’s $590 Billion DeepSeek Rout Is Largest in Market History,"ALTERNATIVE SOURCE — Bloomberg: Nvidia Corp.’s plunge, fueled by investor concern about Chinese artificial-intelligence startup DeepSeek, erased a record amount of stock-market value from the world’s largest company. 

Nvidia shares tumbled 17% Monday, the biggest drop since March 2020, erasing $589 billion from the company’s market capitalization. That eclipsed the previous record — a 9% drop in September that wiped out about $279 billion in value — and was the biggest in US stock-market history. 

The drop rippled through the rest of the market due to how much weight Nvidia has in major indexes. Including Monday’s slump, Nvidia selloffs have caused eight of the top ten biggest one-day drops in the S&P 500 Index, based on market value, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The S&P 500 fell 1.5% Monday and the Nasdaq 100 tumbled nearly 3%.

The semiconductor maker led a broader selloff in technology stocks after DeepSeek’s low-cost approach reignited concerns that big US companies have poured too much money into developing artificial intelligence. The Chinese firm appears to provide a comparable performance at a fraction of the price. 

The latest AI model of DeepSeek, released last week, is widely seen as competitive with those of OpenAI and Meta Platforms Inc. The open-sourced product was founded by quant-fund chief Liang Wenfeng and is now at the top of Apple Inc.’s App Store rankings. 

“Concerns have immediately emerged that it could be a disruptor to the current AI business model, which relies on high end chips and extensive computing power and hence energy,” Jefferies analysts said in a note to clients.

Nvidia has been the biggest beneficiary of the influx in spending on AI because they design semiconductors used in the technology. While that heavy spending looks poised to continue, investors may grow wary of rewarding companies that aren’t showing a sufficient return on the investment. 

Meta announced plans on Friday to boost capital expenditures on AI projects this year by about half to as much as $65 billion, sending its shares to a record high. That came on the heels of OpenAI, SoftBank Group Corp. and Oracle Corp. announcing a $100 billion joint venture called Stargate to build out data centers and AI infrastructure projects around the US. 

In a bid to stall China’s progress in AI, the US has banned the export of advanced semiconductor technologies to the country and is limiting sales of advanced Nvidia AI chips to others. But DeepSeek’s progress suggests Chinese AI engineers have found a way to work around the export bans, focusing on greater efficiency with limited resources.

Nvidia said in a statement Monday that DeepSeek’s model is an “excellent AI advancement” and indicated that the Chinese company didn’t violate US restrictions that limit access to advanced US chips in creating its technology. It also added that inference, or the work of running AI models, requires “requires significant numbers of Nvidia GPUs and high-performance networking.”

wallstreetbets,Deepseek is good for $NVDA - Here's why,"So unless you've been living under a rock, NVIDIA's stock just took a massive hit (-16%) after this Chinese company DeepSeek dropped what might be the biggest AI flex of 2025: They supposedly built a GPT-4 level model for just $6M. Not billion. Million. Using old NVIDIA hardware that China's not even supposed to have anymore.

I've been following the AI space for a while, and this is wild for a few reasons:

First off, this is basically like someone saying they built a Ferrari in their garage for the price of a used Civic. Everyone's freaking out because if these folks really pulled this off with older GPUs (H800s/A100s), what's even the point of dropping $30k+ on new H100s?

The Elon drama isn't helping either - my man's out here claiming DeepSeek's got 50k illegal H100s stashed under some boba shop in Shenzhen 💀

But here's where it gets interesting - there's this old economic concept called Jevons Paradox (bear with me). Basically, when something gets more efficient/cheaper, people end up using MORE of it, not less. Think about when coal got more efficient in the 1800s - instead of using less coal, suddenly everything and their mother was running on steam power.

So here's my spicy take: What if cheaper AI training is actually GOOD for NVIDIA? Follow me here:

* If building AI models gets stupid cheap, every CS dropout with a dream is gonna try launching an AI startup
* All those AIs need somewhere to actually run (inference)
* And guess who makes the best chips for running AI? Our boys in green

I mean, Zuck just committed $65B to AI infrastructure. My man's buying GPUs like they're Taylor Swift tickets lmao

That said, I'm the same idiot who bought AMD at the top, so maybe take this with a grain of salt 🤡

Curious what you all think:

* Are we witnessing the end of NVIDIA's AI dominance or is this a massive overreaction?
* If China's doing this much with old hardware, how screwed is Silicon Valley?
* Is your portfolio also on fire or did you actually listen to your financial advisor?

wallstreetbets,NVDA’s DeepSeek Sell-Off: This Is a Jevons Paradox Buying Opportunity,"NVIDIA (NVDA) is down hard, dropping from $142 to $126 pre-market after hype around DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup achieving more with less compute. The market fears efficient AI models will hurt GPU demand, but this reaction misses the bigger picture.

Why This Is Bullish Long-Term

	1.	Jevons Paradox: Efficiency doesn’t reduce demand—it increases it. As AI becomes cheaper and more accessible, more businesses, startups, and individuals will adopt it, driving more GPU sales.

	2.	New Markets: Efficient models mean more local AI deployments (edge computing) and new industries adopting AI. NVIDIA’s products (DGX, Jetson, RTX GPUs) are perfectly positioned for this shift.

	3.	Redistribution, Not Decline: The demand for AI is evolving, not shrinking. NVIDIA will sell to thousands of smaller players, adding to their hyperscaler business.

	4.	Software Moat: CUDA and TensorRT ensure NVIDIA stays at the center of AI workflows, even as the market shifts.

At $126, this is classic overreaction. AI isn’t slowing—it’s expanding. NVDA is still the backbone of the industry, and this dip is a buying opportunity for long-term investors.

TL;DR: DeepSeek highlights AI’s growth, not NVIDIA’s decline. Efficiency drives broader adoption, and NVDA’s hardware/software dominance makes them a winner. Thoughts? Buying the dip?

Update: NVDA dropped to $116.94 at its lowest point today. Making it the largest one day drop of any stock, almost 600 Billion. Good luck regards.

wallstreetbets,Sell side analyst notes on NVDA this morning,"BofA: 'DeepSeek Concerns Overblown in AI Semis; but Foundational Models Keep Demand High'

 ""On January 20, China-based AI lab DeepSeek created a mini-flurry in the AI semiconductor space by releasing a free, open-source R1 model that reportedly outperforms leading Western AI models, such as OpenAI's GPT-4. The model's creators claimed it took only two months and less than $6 million to build using older-generation NVIDIA H800 chips.

If accurate, this advancement suggests model usefulness and accuracy might not scale directly with compute/memory/networking, potentially reducing the demand for expensive AI chips. However, we believe this concern about slowing AI scaling is overstated. Based on available data, DeepSeek's model appears to be a 'distilled' model relying on larger foundation models like Meta's open-source Llama.

It is these foundational LLMs where significant and rising infrastructure costs are incurred, as evidenced by Meta's plan to raise CY25E capex by over 56% year-over-year to $60-$65 billion. In our view, we will continue to see increasing compute demand driven by a mix of large foundational models (both proprietary and open-source), derivative models (leveraging techniques such as knowledge distillation, sparse attention, and low-rank factorization), and inference at scale across diverse cloud, enterprise, and sovereign AI customers.

We maintain our Buy ratings on NVIDIA (NVDA), Broadcom (AVGO), and Marvell Technology (MRVL).""

JPMorgan analyst Sandeep Deshpande: ""Investors are concerned that rather than impede China's progress in AI, the US restrictions have engendered innovation that has enabled the development of a model that prioritises efficiency. ... The news over the past few months has been about the huge capex announcements of Microsoft, which is spending $80bn in '25, while Meta recently announced investments between $6bn and $65bn. Open AI also announced that the Stargate project intends to invest $500m over the next four years building new AI infrastructure in the US. Thus, with these considerable sums flowing into AI investments in the US, that Deepseek's highly efficient and lower resource-intensive AI model has shown such significant innovation and success is posing thoughts to investors that the AI investment cycle may be over-hyped and a more efficient future is possible."" 

Jefferies analyst Edison Lee: ""Re-evaluating computing power needs could cause 2026 AI Capex to fall (or not grow)...We believe DS's success could drive two possible industry strategies: 1) still pursue more computing power to drive even faster model improvements, and 2) refocus on efficiency and ROI, meaning lower demand for computing power as of 2026."" 

Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon: ""Is DeepSeek doomsday for AI buildouts? We don't think so...we believe that 1) DeepSeek DID NOT ""build OpenAI for $5M""; 2) the models look fantastic but we don't think they are miracles; and 3) the resulting Twitterverse panic over the weekend seems overblown."" Though Rasgon acknowledged DeepSeek's models are good. The analyst kept his outperform ratings on Nvidia and Broadcom, advising clients not to buy into the doomsday scenarios. 

Citi analyst Malik: ""While the dominance of the US companies on the most advanced AI models could be potentially challenged, that said, we estimate that in an inevitably more restrictive environment, US' access to more advanced chips is an advantage. Thus, we don't expect leading AI companies would move away from more advanced GPUs."" Malik maintained a buy rating on Nvidia . 

Raymond James' semiconductor analyst Srini Pajjuri: ""If DeepSeek's innovations are adopted broadly, an argument can be made that model training costs could come down significantly even at U.S. hyperscalers, potentially raising questions about the need for 1-million XPU/GPU clusters as projected by some...: A more logical implication is that DeepSeek will drive even more urgency among U.S. hyperscalers to leverage their key advantage (access to GPUs) to distance themselves from cheaper alternatives."" Pajjuri reiterated buy ratings on Nvidia and ASML. 

Cantor analyst C.J. Muse: ""Following release of DeepSeek's V3 LLM, there has been great angst as to the impact for compute demand, and therefore, fears of peak spending on GPUs. We think this view is farthest from the truth and that the announcement is actually very bullish with AGI seemingly closer to reality and Jevons Paradox almost certainly leading to the AI industry wanting more compute, not less."" Muse said buy Nvidia on any weakness.","['NVDA', 'META', 'META', 'NVDA', 'MSFT', 'META', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'NVDA']",146,102,69,2025-01-27 13:55:01+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ib9lud/sell_side_analyst_notes_on_nvda_this_morning/,0.9948

wallstreetbets,$MGNI Part 2: Why DOJ vs. Google Could Be a Multi-Bagger Opportunity,"Glad you all enjoyed my [MGNI DD last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1i7omel/why_mgni_will_soar_after_nflxs_blowout_earnings/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). This afternoon, I did a deeper dive on a catalyst on the horizon that almost no one is takling about. I actually didn't discover this myself until a discussion that stemmed from the comments last week, where a commentor asked about other catalysts that may benefit the stock and I began digging into it.

So, here it is:

**The DOJ vs. Google: What’s Happening**

The DOJ’s antitrust case against Google is moving quickly, and 2025 is shaping up to be a pivotal year. With remedies for both the search monopoly and ad tech trials expected to roll out in the first half of the year, Magnite (MGNI) stands to benefit from a major industry shift that should absolutely factor into the investment thesis.

The DOJ’s antitrust efforts have gained significant traction, beginning with their landmark win in the search monopoly trial in August 2024. The court ruled that Google held an illegal monopoly in search and text ads, with evidence of document destruction and exclusionary practices further damaging their defense.

[‘Google Is a Monopolist,’ Judge Rules in Landmark Antitrust Case](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/05/technology/google-antitrust-ruling.html)

**As a result, the upcoming remedies—expected in first half of 2025—could include:**

• Ending Default Search Agreements, Divesting Chrome or Android, Mandating Data Sharing, etc.

Meanwhile, the DOJ’s ad tech trial, which concluded in late 2024, focuses specifically on Google’s dominance of the sell-side ad market. Google controls 85% of ad auctions through its Ad Manager platform, with a monopolistic 20% take rate compared to an industry average of 10%. The remedies for this case, expected in Q1/Q2 2025, could force Google to divest key ad tech assets or cap their take rates, disrupting their long-held dominance.

**Why MGNI is a Top Beneficiary from the Google Antitrust Case**

Magnite already has a strong core business, as discussed in the previous DD, particularly in the high-growth Connected TV (CTV) advertising market, where they’ve partnered with major players like Netflix and Disney. However, the potential upside from Google’s antitrust challenges adds another layer to the investment thesis.

Here’s why MGNI stands to benefit significantly:

*1. Market Leadership*

MGNI is the largest independent supply-side platform, making it a natural destination for ad dollars that may leave Google’s ecosystem.

*2. Growth in CTV Advertising*

CTV advertising is one of the fastest-growing segments in digital media, and MGNI is already established as a leader in this space. As publishers and advertisers look for alternatives to Google, MGNI is well-positioned to capture that demand.

*3. Valuation Mispricing*

Even without antitrust tailwinds, MGNI appears undervalued based on its standalone business. In Q3 2024, Magnite reported a 23% YoY increase in CTV contribution ex-TAC to $64.4M, highlighting its strong position in the booming ad-supported streaming market. With $50.6M in adjusted EBITDA, the company demonstrates profitable and scalable growth. Sustained momentum in CTV could propel its market cap beyond $5B, solidifying its role as a key industry player.

A $5B market cap would value $MGNI at over $35/share.

**Why Puts on Google Are Also Worth Considering, given that the stock just hit ATH's**

If you’re bearish on Google’s ability to navigate all of this, puts could also be a viable play. The antitrust remedies could impact their core business in several ways:

• Revenue Compression – Default search agreements and high ad tech take rates have been key profit drivers. Losing these would significantly reduce margins and revenue.

• Structural Divestitures – Divesting platforms like Chrome or Android would reduce Google’s network effects and their ability to dominate both search and advertising markets.

• Behavioral Changes – Even without divestitures, remedies like interoperability requirements and capped take rates would make Google’s ad business far less profitable.

While Google has navigated challenges before, these antitrust remedies are likely to have a much more fundamental impact on their business model than previous fines or restrictions.

**Timing Matters**

As we approach February, the timeline for key antitrust decisions is drawing near, with remedies expected in early 2025. Once finalized, these decisions will likely prompt a market repricing of both Google shares and beneficiaries like $MGNI. For Magnite, the upside is clear: antitrust actions against Google could significantly expand MGNI's addressable market and accelerate growth. Conversely, for Google, the risks are increasing, as the outcomes of these cases could erode its market dominance and profitability.

It's time to place your bets ahead of these developments if you want to hit a multi-bagger.

**TL;DR**

Magnite’s strong core business already supports a bullish investment case, but the DOJ’s antitrust actions against Google provide a massive additional catalyst. If remedies play out as expected in 2025, MGNI stock may even find its way back to ATHs, while some of you might consider puts on Google as an alternative play.

If you have other questions on $MGNI, there is a lot of info that can be found in the post and comments of the [previous DD from last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1i7omel/why_mgni_will_soar_after_nflxs_blowout_earnings/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).

**Position:** Still the same; 6,330 shares of $MGNI and will add to my position on any weakness in the broader market.

wallstreetbets,My loss of 2024,"The word of the day is greed. I started trading options this year (2024) and this is how it went. 
Messed around with some small cap calls lost 100% on some and made 300% on others. my eyes grew big I had no idea you could make 300% off a stock moving 5 or 10%. 
I went HEAVEY into Dd around June and would stay up all night sometimes just to loose the next day but I never gave up. One day around September when they did the rate cuts I heard the news bought in Nvidia and QQQ calls right before close. They both gapped up the next day. I traded on that market open ended up making quite a few trades turned $200 into 5000 in 24 hours.  
I go back to focusing on DD and find my next opportunity.  I remember trading other things making too many trades. Started drinking a lot wishing everyday could be like that day. My account goes down to 2,000. I put everything into Tesla calls right before earnings and my sober mind set up the play where I could buy 100 shares of Tesla at 230 for just 1800 dollars. How? Well Tesla was at 216 and had record sells so I bought a weekly 230 and 13 weekly 240s. I’ll be damned if that plan didn’t work out. But my paper handing ass sold at market open and fucked it all up.  That’s where the downward spiral started. 

In the next trading week 

I went all in on qqq calls 1 dte and it tanked the next day. Anyways after that trade (late October) I went on a downward spiral and a pretty bad one. Almost lost everything. 
(Not just money but my family, house, business). 
I was drinking way to much to cope with the pain was my excuse. but on Christmas I put it down haven’t drank since. Everyday I do dd on company’s and watch the charts. plan my next move also started reading the intelligent investor that Warren buffet recommends. This year will be different I can feel it.

United Airlines Flight 613, a Boeing 787-800, departed from Lagos, Nigeria, at 11:59 p.m. local time on Thursday. The pilot issued a distress signal at 1:20 a.m., and the plane returned to Lagos, landing at 3:22 a.m., according to the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN).

In a statement provided by United Airlines, the company confirmed the plane experienced a “technical issue and an unexpected aircraft movement.” FlightRadar24 data indicated the flight descended abruptly mid-air.

According to FAAN, at least 38 passengers and crew members were injured, including four passengers and two crew members who sustained “serious injuries.” However, the airline’s statement claimed that only six individuals suffered minor injuries and have since been released from the hospital.



The plane, bound for Washington Dulles International Airport in Virginia, was carrying 245 passengers and 11 crew members.

The same plane had been diverted earlier in the week on Tuesday, according to CNN, citing FlightRadar24 data. During that incident, a rapid descent of 1,000 feet was observed approximately 89 minutes into the flight. Investigations into both incidents are currently underway.

wallstreetbets,DD: UiPath ($PATH) - Mispriced and Misunderstood,"I’m looking for the regardedest, lowest, humblest of you to confirm the way.

* Big brains didn’t agree when I said PLTR bumpy revenues weren’t a concern (2022).
* Big brains didn’t agree when I said get into Bitcoin before the wall street wave (2017).
* Big brains didn’t agree when I said Tesla revenues were about to go parabolic (2017).

It’s true when they say Bears sound smart at parties, but the bulls make money.  Big brains are too smart for their own good, blowing up fears in their minds.

Why do I even posts?  Selfishly, to have a record (Reddit post history) of being right.  I love looking back and saying yep, yep, yep and laughing at big brains while wiping my ass with cash.  I didn’t go to Harvard or work for a big firm. I have a chip on my shoulder and I’m here to outclass them all.

So, fellow idiots, I think we have another winner. Time to get hyped.

UiPath ($PATH) $13.86 ($7.617B Market Cap).

**Big brains claim RPA is dead** (https://a16z.com/rip-to-rpa-the-rise-of-intelligent-automation/)

\-	Those pushing AI Agents and claiming RPA is dead are wrong. They assume AI Agents can be developed by skipping straight to step Z, when in reality, they will need to build steps A-Y. AI currently only has a brain. It needs hands and tools connected it to perform real work. UiPath has built out steps A-Y and is ready to take step Z. UiPath is in a position to capitalize on the power of Gen AI.

\-	There’s a spectrum of automation applications and RPA will still make the most sense in many use cases as the most efficient tool for the job (less processing, lower costs and more energy efficient).  AI Agents will have their place, but UiPath will have a system to orchestrate the spectrum of tools spanning from RPA, hybrid to advanced AI agents.

**Big brains claim UiPath has no moat.**

\-	UiPath’s product is more differentiated than the market gives them credit for.  The market seems to conflate all RPA vendors as interchangeable, but I believe there are nuanced and important differences between the offerings.  UiPath appears to be the most robust, user friendly and an innovation leader.

Where’s their moat?

1. Network effects. They have a large install base with 10,000+ customers (easy to upsell clients),
2. UiPath is immune to vendor locking (can automate across many different software provider applications).
3. Preferred vendor/partner to major consulting companies (EY, Deloitte, Accenture).
4. Existing partnerships with major software companies gives UiPath exposure to potential new customers.
5. UiPath has a large base of experienced RPA developers that prefer to use UiPath and who are likely to recommend it where they go.
6. Founder led.  Founder is a product focused engineer, not a career executive playing politics in a bureaucracy. This allows UiPath to be nimbler and seize market opportunities as they arise.

**Big brains claim UiPath’s growth story is over.**

\-	Gen AI can have a similar effect on UiPath as it did on Palantir and their AIP product. Gen AI will make the existing UiPath platform exponentially more powerful, meaning more and higher value use cases. As UiPath AI agent use cases are shared with the world, their sales will accelerate.

**Big brains have beaten this stock to death.**

\-	This stock is down from all time highs at $85.12/share in 2021 to less than $14/share today.

\-	Big brains seem to be discounting UiPath’s potential at a current price-to-sales multiple of 5.275x. SAAS companies can easily trade between 10-20x.

\-	UiPath has $1.6B in cash and $0 debt.

\-	82% gross margins.

\-	113% net dollar retention

\-	On the verge of flipping profitable.

\-	Guidance from last earnings call, they said ARR is expected to stabilize and free cash flow to accelerate.

TLDR:

My bet is UiPath has a greater than 50% chance for growth reacceleration.

UiPath product differentiation will become more apparent in the future.

As UiPath AI agent use cases are shared with the world, their sales will accelerate. (i.e. similar to PLTR with AIP).

None of this is financial advice. I may or may not know what I’m doing.

wallstreetbets,"$ACHR, In Partnership With Anduril, With Potential DoD/DARPA Funding and Phase 1A Already Underway","Archer Aviation May Be About To Deliver Its 6 Military Aircraft to the USAF AFWERX Commitment Soon Including the Reveal of its NEW Hybrid-Propulsion Military-First Midnight/Anduril Variant Aircraft. I wish you and me small retail investors could invest in Anduril. Here's your chance!

**TLDR**; The Archer Aviation and Anduril partnership is going to be extraordinary. If you’ve ever wanted to invest in Anduril as a retail investor, this is your chance! The collaboration between Archer Aviation and Anduril will bring a hybrid-propulsion aircraft capable of exacting Electronic Warfare (EW), RF/Pulsar Intra-connected multi-spread sensors and mission-critical defense applications on the front lines of modern warfare. For this reason I believe ACHR at levels that are below $10 (initial offering) is worth a much larger MCAP of between $10 - $15 Billion and share price of $27 - $30.

And, The new administration along with Saudi Arabia Investment funds have announced $600 Billion in U.S. Investment and specifically this week at Davos The Saudi investment fund announced $20 Billion with 102 signed deals specifically for aviation build out for projects in Riyadh, NEOM, and the red sea initiatives in Saudi Arabia.

Firstly, I noticed that the [new Archer website](https://defense.archer.com/) for it's [Archer Defense](https://defense.archer.com/) division. It looks super serious and in fact, when you look at this list of accomplished Generals, Lieutenant Generals, and Other Military personal it begs the question; How large, and how significant is this potential program of record with the U.S. Military.

https://preview.redd.it/yrgvvktgtyee1.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=35fb0a1012eeedcc3049a24a96b27736f62f0765

An most interesting update, just this week, it was announced that Lieutenant General (Ret) Scott A. Howell, who left Joby recently, came to Archer Aviation as another military advisor and consultant to Archer and Anduril's partnership. Notably he left Joby 20 days prior to the Anduril partnership announcement and joined Archer 2 months later. To me that is a significant development. This plus finding what I think is the program of record is DARPA air initiative for [Strategic Technology Office-wide Broad Agency Announcement](https://www.reddit.com/r/ACHR/comments/1hyoaq5/breaking_major_news_achr_i_found_the_darpadod/)  is perhaps the program Archer and Anduril will apply to.

Moreover, this quote just released this week by Lt. Gen. Howell is more proof and confirmation to what I have researched and discovered for my thesis. Archer already has begun this program of record and it's significant.

https://preview.redd.it/z92uix3jtyee1.png?width=1192&format=png&auto=webp&s=8c479e73d9f446abc9cfc4d1b8aaf786fadde416

There are 3 things on the site that caught my attention, besides the obvious amazing announcement of the partnership with Anduril.

At first glance I was thinking this was a down the road thing and that they would have to do something in ""hopes"" that the DoD would fund. But I think this is way more immediate and significant than what I initially thought.

1. Archer places something on the front page of their website that is very interesting. It says **""1. Rapid Development: Proven ability to quickly design, build, and test next gen aircraft within \~18 months""** So there are 2 parts to this.

First, Archer has a history of getting out aircraft in 18 months. I didn't really notice this before. But it fits like a glove. First, they announced and presented Maker in June 3, 2021 and unveiled it June 10, 2021. Literally on the 18 month nose they announced Midnight in November 2022 and presented it in November 15, 2022. After that, they completed its first uncrewed hover test flight on October 24, 2023.

From the initial Midnight unveiling literally roughly \~18 months later Archer completed its first transition flight moving from vertical to wing-borne flight, on June 8, 2024. And 2 months after that Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force for evaluation under the AFWERX Agility Prime contract.

That's a lot of 18 month pacing that they seem to be really be on target for achieving. With that being said, where does all of that 18 month stuff come from? Well, look none other than a current DARPA project with Bell Textron (Bell helicopters) and Aurora Flight Sciences (Boeing). First, let's pause for a moment to look at Aurora's absolutely stunning x-plane concept drone they are building.

https://preview.redd.it/kfysmanptyee1.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6fd9d0372fd1da39a3365c65823c1ce4525f0e2c

That looks simply fantastic and will fly at Mach 0.7. But that's not the interesting part. Look at the [DARPA project programs page](https://www.darpa.mil/research/programs/speed-and-runway-independent-technologies).

https://preview.redd.it/z9eulqx5uyee1.png?width=1218&format=png&auto=webp&s=45854e088972f349122db405531109cfc1d61d2e

If you're counting that time time frame is exactly 18 months! 6 months and approximately one year. What this is not explaining is that Phase 1B probably had a 6 month phase 1A which resulted in the 2 aforementioned getting the award to move forward.

So again, look at the website from Archer Defense.

https://preview.redd.it/l6hlw8cguyee1.png?width=2326&format=png&auto=webp&s=809cdf1ceb8736f23c60025d9e4cfdcd9be3bd57

If you notice on the DARPA website there is no longer any information about Phase 1A if it was there. Here's what I mean. I can't find the public listings for November 1 2023 announcements anywhere. But what I can find are clues. [Evtol.news first reported this on Dec 24 2023](https://evtol.news/news/four-companies-dash-for-darpas-sprint).

>On Nov. 1, the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ([DARPA](https://evtol.news/darpa-ancillary-tactical-drone-proposer)) announced that it had selected four companies — [Aurora Flight Sciences](http://evtol.news/aurora/), [Bell](http://evtol.news/bell-air-taxi), Northrop Grumman and [Piasecki Aircraft](https://evtol.news/piasecki-ares-concept-design) — to design prototypes for a high-speed vertical takeoff and landing (HSVTOL) X-Plane.  
...  
**Aurora Flight Sciences announced on Nov. 15** that it is working on a blended-wing-body design for its bid for SPRINT. For vertical lift, the concept will feature lift fans embedded in the wings. In designing its SPRINT concept, **the Virginia-based Boeing subsidiary will leverage experience on programs like the Boeing X-48 blended wing body aircraft and Aurora Excalibur, a jet-powered VTOL drone.**

This brings me to [Aurora, which announced their participation November 15 2023](https://www.aurora.aero/2023/11/15/aurora-flight-sciences-to-design-high-speed-vertical-lift-x-plane).

>**Program leverages over 30 years of investment in novel VTOL and blended wing body platforms.**

>Aurora Flight Sciences, a Boeing Company, has been selected for phase 1 of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) SPeed and Runway INdependent Technologies (SPRINT) X-Plane Demonstration Project. This project aims to design, build, and fly an X-Plane to demonstrate technologies and integrated concepts necessary for a transformational combination of aircraft speed and runway independence. This initial award funds work to reach a conceptual design review and includes an executable option to continue work through preliminary design review.

Something that was announced on November 1, 2023 was already awarded 1A by November 15, 2023? Damn that's fast. lol. Good job Boeing! My point is, those projects aren't just push a button and get rewarded. They are arduous processes that are tailored to what can be not just awarded but what can be expected to be successfully completed.

They are arduous processes that are tailored to what can be not just awarded but what can be expected to be successfully completed.

Now, here is the juicy part. In that same [eVTOL.news](http://evtol.news/) publication I told you above. There is also this little nugget of information.

>**The SPRINT program builds on an earlier initiative, the Air Force’s High-Speed VTOL Challenge, launched by AFWERX technology incubator in 2021** (see “[Air Force Picks 11 Companies for High-Speed VTOL Program](https://evtol.news/news/air-force-picks-11-companies-for-high-speed-vtol-program),” *Vertiflite*, March/ April 2022). Of the four SPRINT competitors, three — Bell, Northrop Grumman and Piasecki Aircraft — were involved in AFWERX’s Challenge.

AFWERX - Where have we heard that name before? That's right - Archer Aviation is also apart of the AFWERX program! This is my next point from the [defense.archer.com](http://defense.archer.com/) website

2. Archer is already involved heavily in the AFWERX program.

https://preview.redd.it/cv8n7ryruyee1.png?width=2260&format=png&auto=webp&s=56ee376f428429b4c92e537d466931dc194181ca

In case that text is too small let me make it a little larger for you.

**the goal of our $148M\* deal with the air force's AFWERX program is to assess the transformational potential of VTOL technologies for DoD purposes.**

**\*Largest ""up to"" contract awarded by AFWERX to an eVTOL company based on publicly available information as of December 2024.**

This AFWERX Program has been around since April 2021. **To make sure we are tracking here Archer Aviation announced its intention to go public through a Special Purpose Acquisition Company February 10, 2021 and began trading on the NYSE September 17, 2021. Coincidence?** I don't know, but that is very very interesting.

Here's a report again, from [eVTOL.news about the initiation of the program Aug 25 2021](https://evtol.news/news/air-force-challenges-industry-for-high-speed-vtol).

>Air Force Challenges Industry for High-Speed VTOL

>**The US Air Force (USAF), in partnership with the US Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), initiated the “High-Speed Vertical Take-Off and Landing (HSVTOL) Concept Challenge”** in April (see “Industry Briefs,” [*Vertiflite*, July/Aug 2021](https://vtol.org/store/product/vertiflite-julyaugust-2021-16931.cfm)). According to the USAF’s AFWERX unit, “The near-term challenge goal is to produce an HSVTOL conceptual framework that maximizes the trade space of speed, range, survivability, payload, size, and flexibility to carry out missions across the full spectrum of conflict and political scenarios. Critical mission profiles include Infiltration and Exfiltration of Special Operations Forces (SOF) and Equipment; Personnel Recovery; Aeromedical Evacuation; and Tactical Mobility.” A key feature of the HSVTOL Challenge is the amount of publicly available information in order to encourage collaboration and “crowdsourcing” complementary ideas and technologies.

>**A total of 218 proposals were submitted entries, with 35 solutions selected for further discussion.** According to Aviation Week (“[AFWerx Challenge Showcases High-Speed VTOL Concepts](https://aviationweek.com/aerospace/emerging-technologies/afwerx-challenge-showcases-high-speed-vtol-concepts),” Aug. 3), two dozen were focused on aircraft designs (see table below), with the remaining 11 being system technologies (such as improvements to engines, materials or radars). The 35 selected responses were presented to the USAF in mid-August and may receive funding for further research, development and testing, with the potential for future procurement contracts for production and fielding. Four companies made announcements in early August that they had been selected and provided additional insights, as detailed below.

[In February 2022 only 11 survived the first cut (Phase 1) to go through the aforementioned AFWERX HSVTOL program](https://evtol.news/news/air-force-picks-11-companies-for-high-speed-vtol-program). Keep in mind this is not the DARPA The SPRINT X-Plane program but apparently it may have been the precursor program? Remember DARPA's program here notes - ""**The Speed and Runway Independent Technologies (SPRINT) project** is a joint DARPA/U.S. Special Operations Command effort that aims to design, build, and fly an X-plane to demonstrate the key technologies and integrated concepts that enable a transformational combination of aircraft speed and runway independence."" 

* American Aerospace Engineering
* Astro Aerospace
* **Bell Textron**
* Continuum Dynamics
* **Jaunt Air Mobility**
* Jetoptera
* Piasecki Aircraft Corporation
* Transcend Air
* Valkyrie Systems Aerospace
* VerdeGo Aero
* Whisper

So to summarize because there is 2 pgrams going on at once. Only 2 of the above listed companies survived to Phase 2 in the AFWERX Challenge.[ Bell Textron and Jaunt Air Mobility reported on February 1 2022](https://www.aero-news.net/index.cfm?do=main.textpost&id=1F5CEADA-45F0-4FED-8D44-FC4695979372).

As you see, Bell Textron is in both the AFWERX Challenge HSVTOL and DARPA SPRINT programs.

So where is Archer Aviation in all of this you may be wondering because they are part of AFWERX too right? Yes, they are but it's under a different program launched by the US Air Force way back in February 2020 also reported by evtol.news. [This program is called the AFWERX Agility Prime](https://evtol.news/news/us-air-force-moves-to-boost-evtol-development).

>**US Air Force Moves to Boost eVTOL Development**

>The service hopes to help aircraft developers get FAA certification as it weighs becoming an “early adopter” of air taxi vehicles for utility missions.

The Air Force marked the 116th anniversary of the Dec. 17, 1903, Wright brothers flight at Kitty Hawk by issuing a request for information (RFI) aimed at helping foster a new powered flight revolution — electric or hybrid electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft — eventually self-flying.  
...  
**Agility Prime has different funding mechanisms designed to support the extremely fast contracting and payment philosophy the Air Force believes is essential to move at “Silicon Valley” speed.**  
...  
**Rapid Contracting**  
While many are quick to point to the Air Force engagement on the technological side, “what Dr. Roper and Col. Diller did in terms of procurement is absolutely the biggest innovation of this entire Agility Prime thing,” said Kyle Clark, CEO of Beta Technologies.

“We all think we are smart, hot sh\*ts for developing airplanes, but Dr. Roper and Col. Diller navigated a massively arcane procurement system and installed something that was fast and efficient. With all my prior years of doing stuff for the Army and for others in my prior businesses, I’ve never seen a procurement activity go that efficiently. So, in my mind, that was probably the biggest innovation and that’s what’s giving them an edge over others,” he said. “It’s a cultural thing driven by Dr. Roper that was just visionary…. I’ve gone for programs that take a year to contract. That we have received four \[Agility Prime\] contracts in just over a year is astounding,” said Clark.

From this announcement only these companies were announced in March 3, 2021.

* Joby Aviation
* Beta Technologies
* LIFT Aircraft
* Sabrewing Aircraft
* Elroy Air

Of those you can probably recognize 2 of the above names. Joby and Beta Technologies. But where is Archer Aviation?

Remember, Archer became a publicly traded company in September 17, 2021 from a previous announcement in February 10, 2021. So in March eVTOL News wasn't really aware of Archer Aviation. But boy oh boy Archer was moving FAST and EXECUTING FAST.

The first time we hear about Archer Aviation in the AFWERX program is basically [from their own announcement which was posted on Archer's website September 3, 2021](https://news.archer.com/archer-enters-agreement-with-united-states-air-force-to-collaborate-on-flight-testing). Again, tracking, Archer likes to move FAST, EXECUTE FAST, and apparently, they like to move in SILENCE. Unlike Helicopters no doubt ;-)

From that date about \~20 months later on July 31, 2023 Archer Aviation was awarded through the [U.S. Air Force's AFWERX program a record funding amount of $142 Million](https://investors.archer.com/news/news-details/2023/U.S.-Air-Force-and-Archer-Enter-Into-Contracts-Worth-Up-to-142-Million-Representing-Landmark-Investment-In-eVTOL-Technology-by-U.S.-Military/default.aspx).

AND IF WE'RE TRACKING (yes I'm tracking lol) 18 MONTHS TO THE DAY IS **JANUARY 31, 2025**.

Remember, they delivered their first test Midnight to the Air Force on August 15, 2024.

So where are those 6 aircraft? 18 months is very soon to today's date.

Look at Archer's own words:

https://preview.redd.it/05i6d1m8vyee1.png?width=1741&format=png&auto=webp&s=3741606540574c203aaaa3bdbb7ce84d9331ea0d

Where are those 6 aircraft?

On the FAA registration page for Archer Aviation, Inc we see **6** not yet registered aircraft!

https://preview.redd.it/5s74v74lwyee1.png?width=1956&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a413e737ae7c8a87782edb695fb89960221c186

WOW! If Archer pulls this off it will be a miracle amongst miracles. Adam Goldstein and the Archer Team will become eVTOL sainthood!

3. Archer's military relationship is exhibiting full tilt leadership by executing for the US military in an unprecedented speed, quality, and efficiency.

Archer not only started from behind but in my strong opinion has caught up and surpassed EVERYONE including Joby Aviation with a practical and beautiful production aircraft that is ready now. Adam has been all over the news networks basically saying Midnight is complete we are moving on to a partnership with Anduril on a major DoD project program of record. Here is Adam's News Interview.

Now, I don't know when that program will get officially announced but remember the 15 day window that Aurora basically announced after the fact that they had been selected for the Phase 1A portion of the HSVTOL SPRINT DoD program. Archer may very well be in the program.

**UNIQUELY POSITIONED TO WIN**

**RAPID DEVELOPMENT \~18 MONTHS**

If you're bragging about getting shit done in 18 months lol well those 6 aircraft should be about done.

And just look at this military brass. These guys retire early and this is what they do. They deliver connections and guidance that is unprecedented. And if they smell program winner they are going attach themselves to a program winner.

Do you see 8 highly decorated Army officers on anyone else's website for eVTOL programs? I don't see that on anyone else's website.

I think Archer not only is going after a Government contract I think they have been groomed and ready to dominate a government contract. I think they are about to deliver those 6 aircraft soon! I think there production facility in Georgia was perfectly positioned to not only build Midnight but to also build Nightfall Hybrid-Propulsion VTOL aircraft for the U.S. Military and they may have already begun the work on exactly that.

As well, I think this Anduril partnership and announcement has way bigger implications and way more information than we may realize.

Lastly, I think those 6 aircraft may actually be piloted aircraft and that is why you are seeing all of that [Flight training information in the news](https://www.vertexsolutions.com/news/article/2024/12/vertex-solutions-and-archer-aviation-complete-cutting-edge-mixed-reality-flight-simulator-for-evtol-pilot-training?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

Now, remember, this is all speculation but in my mind it tracks. I think we are about to have a **hell of a 2025 for ACHR!**

wallstreetbets,Why $MGNI Will Soar After $NFLX’s Blowout Earnings Yesterday,"So after I posted my YOLO on Magnite this morning, some of you mentioned in the comments that it would be helpful for me to drop a DD. Buckle up, my friends— why I'm long Magnite $MGNI

(Although for some reason I don’t think of them as “Magnite” in my head, I say it at Magini or Maggie because that how the ticker sounds lol)

Anyway, let me explain why I think it’s time to load the boat on shares of this company, and especially how it’s a play to cash in on the blowout earnings report from Netflix $NFLX yesterday.



# The Play: Buying $MGNI on takeaways from $NFLX’s blowout quarter yesterday

Obviously, the smart money move isn’t to wait for a stock to go up to buy it. It’s to buy when news comes out that you *know* will positively impact future earnings or another company in the sector/industry. 

Magnite has been crushing it with partnerships (Disney, Netflix, Samsung, FIFA, and United Airlines are outlined below), and the holiday season being during Q4 means CTV ad spend went through the roof.

Think about it: over the holidays, what were you and your family doing? Watching Disney/Netflix? Streaming sports? Magnite powers the ads you see on those platforms. Now, they’re set to rake in massive revenue from the holiday season.



# Why Netflix's Q4 Success Signals Big Wins for Magnite 🚀

Netflix's Q4 2024 earnings smashed expectations, revealing major growth in the ad-supported streaming market—a sector Magnite ($MGNI) dominates. Here’s the breakdown:

1. Ad Tier Adoption Surges: 55% of Netflix’s new subscribers in ad-supported markets chose the ad tier, doubling Netflix’s ad revenue YoY in 2024 and projected to double again in 2025. This expands the addressable market for connected TV (CTV) advertising tech, where Magnite is the clear leader.
2. Magnite's Market Leadership: As the world’s largest independent sell-side advertising platform, Magnite already earns \~50% of its revenue from CTV and expects to grow that segment by 15% or more annually. Their platform is projected to generate billions in ad spend over the coming years, aligning with Netflix's growth trajectory.
3. Publisher Monetization Boom: Netflix’s success in monetizing its ad tier proves advertisers want premium CTV inventory. Magnite specializes in helping publishers monetize content, benefiting directly from this growing demand.

Netflix’s stellar results confirm that ad-supported streaming is here to stay, creating a massive tailwind for Magnite. $MGNI is poised to ride this wave of growth.



# Facts & Data: Magnite’s Tailwinds 🌬️

1. **$25 Billion+ TAM for CTV Advertising -** The connected TV market is exploding, and Magnite is sitting at the center of it all. They’re the world’s largest independent sell-side advertising platform, making them the key player for streaming ad monetization.
2. [**Disney Partnership**](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/10/23/2967786/0/en/Disney-and-Magnite-Announce-Two-Year-Deal-Renewal.html)
   * Expanded to include LATAM inventory, podcasts, and live sports.
   * Monetizing College Football live streams on ESPN.
   * Jamie Power, Disney SVP: *“Magnite consistently scales its capabilities to meet client needs, helping us stay ahead of emerging market trends.”*
      1. Note that Magnite allows brands like Disney to whitelist their ad tech as “their own,” so you might hear Disney talk about the work they are doing to build their ad stack over the next several years.
3. [**Netflix’s Partnership**](https://www.magnite.com/blog/netflix-selects-magnite-as-key-global-programmatic-advertising-partner/)
   * Magnite is Netflix's programmatic advertising partner globally, which began in summer 2024.
   * Sean Buckley, CRO at Magnite: *“We’re thrilled to help Netflix leverage programmatic advertising to bring their amazing content to millions worldwide.”*
      1. Note that Magnite allows brands like Netflix to whitelist their ad tech as “their own,” so you might hear Netflix talk about the work they are doing to build their ad stack over the next several years.
4. **Other Partnerships from the past year**
   * [**Samsung Ads**](https://investor.magnite.com/news-releases/news-release-details/magnite-strengthens-partnership-samsung-ads-power-programmatic): Powering programmatic advertising on Samsung TV Plus
   * [**FIFA**](https://www.magnite.com/press/fifa-selects-magnite-as-part-of-their-global-programmatic-expansion/): Magnite supports global video advertising for FIFA+.
   * [**United Airlines**](https://www.magnite.com/press/united-selects-magnites-springserve-to-power-advertising-solution-for-inflight-personal-device-entertainment/): Ads on inflight personal device entertainment, a new frontier for CTV.
   * [**LG Ad Solutions**](https://www.magnite.com/press/lg-ads-renews-global-partnership-with-magnite/): Deep integration for ad-serving tech across LG’s global CTV footprint.



# Financials: A Strong Foundation 

* **Q3 2024 Performance**:
   * Revenue: $162M (+8% YoY)
   * Net Income: $5.2M 
   * Adjusted EBITDA: $50.6M
   * CTV contribution ex-TAC: $64.4M (+23% YoY)
* **Q4 2024 Earnings Expectations**:With the holiday season and their partnerships firing on all cylinders, expect significant upside. 

# Simple Explanation: How Magnite Works 

Ever watched a show on Netflix and seen an ad? That’s where Magnite comes in. They’re the tech backbone that connects advertisers with streaming services. Think of them as a digital middleman, making sure the right ads get to the right people, at the right time. For every transaction, Magnite earns a fee.

# Why $MGNI Will Pop 

1. The **Netflix & Disney partnerships** will help fuel this, in addition to other recent partnership announcements outlined above. Both streaming giants are leaning heavily into ad-supported models, with Magnite’s platform as their backbone.
2. The holiday season drove massive engagement on CTV platforms. Think family binge-watching sessions and College Football bowl games.
3. Magnite’s **tech leadership** is cementing its dominance in CTV, digital display, and mobile advertising.



**TL;DR**

Netflix’s earnings yesterday made one thing clear: the future of ad-supported streaming is booming, and Magnite is perfectly positioned to capitalize. Operating in a sector with a $25B+ TAM, blockbuster partnerships, and surging CTV growth, $MGNI is a no-brainer with only a $2.3B market cap.

**Position:** I’m long like Donkey Kong—6,330 shares deep. I don’t mess with calls, but if that’s your vibe, I’d go with March calls to play the earnings pop. If anyone wants to throw up a technical analysis of $MGNI, or discuss in the comments, I’d love to see it (because I don’t understand that shit).

Starting summer 2024, Magnite became Netflix’s  global programmatic ad partner. Magnite is the largest independent sell-side advertising platform, specializing in digital and streaming ad formats. Think of them as the tech infrastructure behind the ads that we see on platforms like Netflix. 

As of Magnite’s last earnings call, Netflix is slated to become one of Magnite’s largest customers by the end of 2025.

TL;DR: As Netflix’s ad-supported tiers continue to grow, so will Magnite’s revenue through transaction fees. 🚀

wallstreetbets,"Intel will be the surprise overperformer in 2025, starting with the 1/30 ER.","Before I start, I want to preface this by acknowledging the memes and negative connection between intel and the one guy who lost his grandma's funds, but I genuinely believe with how low st. expectations are, combined with intel's massive sell-off these few months, Intel will skyrocket leading up/during the ER @ 1/30/2025.

# 1. Extremely heavy Investments in Manufacturing

* **Tens of Billions Invested**: Intel has invested heavily in manufacturing expansion, aiming to regain technological leadership. These investments are expected to start bearing fruit by 2026 and 2027, positioning Intel as a key U.S.-based semiconductor manufacturer.
   * Now I know ya'll are gonna complain, but that's 2026 and 2027, which is a long ways out! Here's the thing, as long as (they will) Intel acknowleges their progress towards manufacturing, and the expected returns of their investments, especially under the current administration, the upside will be more or less priced in within the report.
* **Alignment with U.S. Government Priorities**: U.S. policy encourages domestic manufacturing of semiconductors, especially with the new Mango administration.
   * It's pretty obvious that the current admin wants to become less dependent on foreign semiconductor manufacturing, and Intel's investments in the space PLUS mango being in power will undoubtedly be great for the stock, and I believe that's what Intel will lean into heavily during the upcoming earnings report with stellar guidance.

# 2. Undervalued Stock Price

* **Current Valuation**: Intel is trading at one of its lowest forward Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratios of the year, at around 20.
* **Intrinsic Value**: Updated discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation indicates an intrinsic value of $36 per share, significantly higher than the current trading price of $19.82. While there may be some other factors, this suggests Intel is trading on a pretty steep discount compared to its market value, way less than other big names.

# 3. Advanced Developments

* **Advanced Node Development**: Intel is investing in advanced manufacturing nodes to close the gap with competitors like TSMC and Samsung. Success in these nodes will make Intel competitive in high-margin markets.
   * I'll admit, I'm not entirely familiar with the development process of these, but I can't imagine this not being bullish for the stock.
* **Gaudi AI Chips**: The release of competitive AI chips (e.g., Gaudi 3) positions Intel to capture a share of the rapidly growing AI market.

# 4. Reduced Competition in Dual Design-Manufacturing Model

* **Unique Positioning**: Intel and Micron remain the only U.S.-based companies pursuing both design and manufacturing, while most competitors focus on design alone. This vertical integration could yield huge advantages as Intel scales.
   * Again, I'm not familiar with the development of chips, but from what I could find, if Intel could pull this off in the long-run, it'll set itself in an extremely unique environment with both design and manufacturing WITHIN the United States. Would be huge for the nation-first agenda under the current administration.

# 5. Support from Geopolitical Tailwinds

* **CHIPS Act Benefits**: Intel is set to benefit from U.S. government incentives under the CHIPS Act, including grants and tax credits for domestic semiconductor manufacturing.
   * Again, huge for a US-based company like Intel.

# 6. Potential Leadership Turnaround

* **CEO Transition**: A change in leadership could bring new strategic clarity and execution capability, particularly in aligning investment timelines with profitability goals.
   * Though Pat was a pretty chill guy, if Intel could bring in someone with large amounts of industry experience, that's another huge upside potential for Intel. They may announce a new CEO during ER or somewhere near it, but I just can't imagine them settling with a mid-tier guy after what they've been through.

# 7. Market Share Opportunities

* **Competitor Weaknesses**: AMD and Nvidia focus on niche areas, leaving room for Intel to grow in data centers, personal computing, and automotive applications.
   * Yes, this does mean that their areas would be very hard to break into, but we've already seen Intel turning around in some aspects, especially their newer desktop gaming GPUs which actually bring in surprising value for performance beyond AMD and Nvidia comparable cards.
* **U.S. Government Contracts**: Intel’s U.S.-based manufacturing advantage makes it a preferred supplier for defense and other government projects, which is yet another large catalyst for the future.

# 8. Focused Financial Discipline

* **Cost Reductions**: Intel has paused dividends and reduced workforce to save over $10 billion by 2025, stabilizing its financial position during this investment-heavy period.
   * I expect to see this being reflected upon in the upcoming 1/30 ER. With a bit more cash freed up and stabilizing finances, I'm pretty confident that it'll be far beyond what the market has been pricing in which is arguably a worst case doomsday scenario.

# Conclusion

Yes, Intel does have a decent amount of debt. Yes, nana's son did lose hundreds of thousands. But it's objectively true that INTC has been beaten down mercilessly these past few months, with a 56% drawdown since the start of 2024. It's entirely possible- likely even- that this is a far overreaction, especially with INTC taking steps to improve leadership, control debts, free up cash, and invest in what's needed. Combine that with the new administration that went into power yesterday, focusing on heavy domestic production, I believe Intel will be the surprise overperformer for this year.

NFA. I hold around $10k in calls expiring next month after the ER, and I am planning on DCAing aggressively into shares to hold for a few years.

wallstreetbets,"Will Intel emerge as a major winner of Stargate $500 billion SoftBank, Microsoft & Oracle venture?","Hey r/wallstreetbets,

I guess last post got deleted because video attached was similar to another post… the video was of Trump announcing the $500 billion Stargate AI venture led by Oracle, OpenAI, and SoftBank.

With that announcement there’s a lot of speculation about which tech giants will benefit the most. Notably, Oracle (which is up 7% today)  and Microsoft are at the helm of this initiative. Given Intel’s deep relationships with both these tech giants, I’m thinking Intel is positioned to be a significant winner in this scenario.

Intel has a longstanding partnership with Oracle, providing advanced processors for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, enhancing the performance and efficiency of AI applications. This relationship could see further deepening with the heavy AI focus of the Stargate initiative.

Moreover, Intel recently made a major 15 billion $ chip deal with Microsoft to manufacture chips, potentially adding another layer to their involvement in the Stargate venture. Microsoft’s interest in using Intel’s foundry services could mean a boost for Intel, especially if their manufacturing capabilities are utilized for any new AI chips or technologies developed through Stargate mean more demand for Intel foundry. 

Considering these factors, it seems like Intel might not just be a participant but a crucial player in making Stargate a success. Do you think Intel’s existing collaborations with Oracle and Microsoft give it an edge in this massive AI project? Could this be a turning point for Intel, especially with their ongoing efforts to expand their foundry business  ? Do you have an opposite hypothesis that this is bad for Intel and why?

Would love to hear your thoughts on this!

TLDR: Grandma died 8 years ago. Left me nothing. So I invested my own money. 

Here's why I like Intel:

* 2024 Q1 up 9% YOY
* Intel has been heavily investing and restructuring by building out the domestic foundry business to manufacture semiconductor chips for third party companies.
* With Intel 3 in production, leading-edge semiconductors are being manufactured in the US for the first time in a decade. Intel will regain process leadership as the Intel Foundry continues to grow.
* I think the fact that Intel is positioning itself to be the largest semiconductor manufacturer in the US is massive. The US Gov is heavily prioritizing domestic semiconductor production and thus is heavily supporting Intel as a company with R&D funding.
* If NVIDIA or AMD are ever forced to change manufacturers due to rising tensions/war between China & Taiwan, Intel will likely be a sole or largest manufacturer for NVIDIA and AMD
* Intel has been heavily investing in R&D. 5.9B out of 12.7B of Q124 revenue was invested in R&D.
* Intel is on track to exceed its forecast of 40 million AI PCs shipped by the end of 2024
* The Intel Gaudi 3AI accelerator is projected to deliver 50% faster inference and 40% greater inference power efficiency than NVIDIA H100 on leading AI models.
* Trading at Forward PE of 17.05
* Geopolitical tensions will ultimately work in Intel's favor more than any other company in this industry

wallstreetbets,Millionaire Maker Micron: $700k YOLO,"Trade idea first came to me when watching a recent All-In Podcast episode. Highly regarded I must admit. Reposting because apparently youtube links aren't allowed.

Key quote for the lazy from the podcast (PLUS TLDR below for the mega regards):

>We're going to run out of compute. It's actually a pretty shocking stat. High bandwidth memory is a bigger part of NVIDIA's COGS on GPUs than Taiwan SEMI is. And today, there's two companies that can make it, SK Hynix and Micron. We'll see if Samsung gets their act together. But HBM memory, it's in NVIDIA GPUs, AMD GPUs, Amazon Terraniums, and particularly in a world of test time Compute and inference being so important, High bandwidth memory is arguably more important than it ever was, and it's been sold out for the last two years.

The trend is your friend, and there is no trend quite like AI. What you may have missed is that there's a big shift in the AI space towards test time compute. That's the future of AI. All the recent advancements, and those on the horizon, are being driven by test time compute. Guess what's essential for test time compute. High bandwidth memory. And guess who is soon to be the number one producer? Micron. Need I say more? Oh yeah, they're also trading like a deep value stock despite insane forward earnings. Completely mispriced. Easy 2-5 bagger over the coming years.

TLDR: This ain't no meme stock, this is the future! High bandwidth memory (HBM, remember it) is gonna be the new buzzword thrown around with reckless abandon, and Micron is the only game in town (SK Hynix is irrelevant - they're un-American).

wallstreetbets,I Paper Handed My Way Out of Scoring Nearly $200k in TSLA Puts Today,"TL:DR; I am a paper handed bitch and even though I made $3k, I am still an idiot.

Introduction: I have been very lucky this year playing puts and calls. I am already up over $103k since 1/1 and I have the receipts. (See my post history for some) So cry me a river indeed.

[Year to date gains in Etrade of $103k for 2025.](https://preview.redd.it/4vqv7g2chnde1.png?width=792&format=png&auto=webp&s=2fa24697a1b42441ea4e3fbf31d43befc36709cb)

Nearly every single play has been buying puts when things seem irrationally high, or buying calls when they've fallen too far? What is too far? Good question. But to play this, you need volume and volatility.

$CEG (Constellation Energy Group) has been the perfect trade for that this year. Four times on three separate days I've bought puts on their frothiness. Yesterday I made $20k off $CEG in about an hour. Good work if you can get it.

[CEG Puts have gotten me $35k in gains even though the stock is up.](https://preview.redd.it/qemqizdvhnde1.png?width=1301&format=png&auto=webp&s=5152767c694055798a43636ece96772a6b02faa4)

So that brings us to today. It's Friday, 0 Day Expiration party time! This morning, lots of things are green, and meme stock Elon plaything Tesla is blowing up like a SpaceX rocket over the Carribean. I am ready to make a killing. It's up 5% from the previous day and, if my results this year are right, it's going to go down. Everything returns to the mean. Nothing finishes at the high of the day.

So I buy 200 Put options for $1.24 at $430. It's a $25k bet and my account is ready.

[TSLA looking frothy midway through the day as I buy puts at 430.](https://preview.redd.it/k67m63joinde1.png?width=464&format=png&auto=webp&s=47da208c002804913328eb67a5dc5b96ba08f465)

But it doesn't go down right away. This is fine, I tell myself as the stock goes up to 436, 437... So I decide to double down and buy 150 put options for $1.46 at $435. It's a $22k bet. I've now got $47k on the line, about half my gains on the year. If the stock traces back to $430, it'll be great. $425 would make serious coin.

But I forgot Tesla stock is fucking insane and every regard in this sub is jerking it to this chart.

[TSLA nears $440 with an hour left in trading and I am seriously boned.](https://preview.redd.it/bph2h3o8jnde1.png?width=641&format=png&auto=webp&s=4fa161caad811a9726e6aae0d48320d99b096a05)

At this point, I have the live chart on my screen and I know I am going to eat shit and be down more than $40k and wipe out everything I've scammed for this year. Every time it comes down to 437, it goes back up to 439. 438. 439. 438. Stupid TSLA.

But wait! With an hour left it starts to fall, just like I thought it would. To $434 at least. My second buy is green more than $10k while my first one is pretty much toast. Every tick up or down is the worst. With less than an hour ago the flip flopping continues. $432. Back up to $433. I realize I am up $21k on one put and down $17k on the other put. I panic sell both and leave with $3k gains. Survival! I was stunned any dork bought my obviously dead put with minutes left.

So what happens? $TSLA crashes (of course) all the way to $426.50 at end of day. I was right.

[End of day: $TSLA at $426.5 after hitting $439 intraday](https://preview.redd.it/l2459uecknde1.png?width=738&format=png&auto=webp&s=74e4ed83b0c3897783421e490ef372230d2d2177)

So let's do the math on those puts:  
$435 - $426.5 = $8.5 \* 150 \* 100 = $127,500  
$430 - $426.5 = $3.5 \* 200 \* 100 = $70,000

I would have cleared $197,500 instead of $3,200 because I was a paper handed bitch and didn't want to lose $47k. This is the worst $3k I've ever made. FML.

wallstreetbets,"Intel gains amid takeover, Musk mentioned","Intel Corp. (NASDAQ:INTC) rose 9% after some vague takeover speculation about the chipmaker.

A report from SemiAccurate was circulating on Friday about a company looking to acquire Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). According to a Citi note, Elon Musk was mentioned as a potential buyer behind the paywall of SemiAccurate.

""We view this as a poor outcome for Intel unless it was able to hire a CEO who would exit the merchant foundry business ...."" Citi analyst Christopher Danely wrote in a note on Friday.

Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) didn't immediately respond to Seeking Alpha's email request for comment.

""About two months ago, SemiAccurate was read an email about a company trying to acquire Intel, whole,"" according to the report. ""We have absolute faith in the accuracy of this email but it took months to confirm it.""

The latest speculation comes after Bloomberg reported in late November that Qualcomm's (QCOM) interest in potentially acquiring Intel waned due to complexities associated with a transaction. Qualcomm could still look at acquiring parts of Intel or rekindle its takeover interest at a later time.

Qualcomm (QCOM) reportedly approached Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) about a potential takeover in September, and had earlier explored buying the chipmaker's design business.

investing,Shorting list for de minimis going away,"
With the de minimis loophole potentially going away, I’m thinking about which companies might take a major hit. Right now, I’m looking at Wayfair, ShipDaddy, and Shopify as potential short opportunities. These companies rely heavily on the current import structure, and if de minimis exemptions are tightened or removed, the impact on their margins could be significant.

For those unfamiliar, the de minimis rule allows small-value imports (under $800) to enter the U.S. duty-free. This has been a game-changer for e-commerce platforms and direct-to-consumer businesses sourcing products from overseas, particularly China. If this advantage disappears, costs will rise, and businesses that rely on it could see reduced profitability, higher prices, and possibly lower consumer demand.

Wayfair has already struggled with profitability, operating in an industry with tight margins and high logistics costs. If de minimis changes increase costs, their ability to offer competitive pricing could be in jeopardy. Shopify, while more diversified, has many merchants who depend on cheap, duty-free imports to sustain their business models. A significant shift in costs could drive some sellers off the platform. As for ShipDaddy and other fulfillment companies, any disruption in international shipping economics could hurt their ability to remain competitive.

Other companies that might be at risk include Temu, Shein, AliExpress, and even Etsy sellers who rely on dropshipping from China. The broader e-commerce and logistics sectors could see ripple effects, depending on how strict the new regulations become.

Would love to hear thoughts—who else should be on the short list if de minimis goes away? Are there any companies that might actually benefit from this change, such as domestic manufacturers or U.S.-based fulfillment centers? Let’s discuss.","['SHOP', 'SHOP']",2,1,0,2025-02-05 12:24:55+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ii8s5w/shorting_list_for_de_minimis_going_away/,0.8364
investing,There is either too much money in the system or people are learining how ti invest,"I am absolutely passionate about investing and I have been for years, with results way above my expectations. I am noticing however that most companies are being priced correctly.

I am not talking about hyper exuberant companies (Tesla, Palantir...) but most blue chip stocks.   
Microsoft, Google, Visa, Mastercard (1.5-3% FCFY plus strong growth) .. but also less growth oriented companies like Pepsi, Kroger... (4-5% FCFY and a bit of growth)... Railways are more stable, so they trade between 3-5% FCY, are all trading around fair value IMO.

Actually I think the equity risk premium is a bit down and right know stocks are fairly priced with respect to treasuries (4-5% FCY, no growth). IMO there are still some attractive opportunities (bought uber last month), but the market is behaving quite well. 

Maybe this is the results of too much money in the system, desperately competing for limited assets, but I also think that people learning about the stock market (and flooding to ETFs) are making it more efficient, not less. 

I am not complaining, I think its ok that people are no longer over ridicolously cheap opportunities. Investing shouldn't be easy, so seeing fair prices is kind of good. Its not the mother of all bubbles, its actually fair that you don't make 15% per year while doing nothing.

investing,Nissan retracts merger agreement with Honda,"In a significant shift in the automotive industry, Nissan has decided to withdraw from the merger agreement it had with Honda, signaling the potential collapse of their planned integration. Originally, the two companies had aimed to create a holding company that would bring them together under a single umbrella, allowing for an alliance between Honda, Nissan, and Mitsubishi. However, Honda's proposal to make Nissan a subsidiary led to strong internal opposition within Nissan, causing the merger talks to unravel. This decision is largely influenced by delays in Nissan's restructuring plans and the growing concerns over its long-term survival as a standalone entity. Nissan's situation is precarious, as its current financial struggles leave it vulnerable to external control. If the merger collapses, both companies face a difficult future, with Honda possibly turning to Mitsubishi for future consolidation efforts.

I think this pullback to the $70 range is overexaggerated and represents a great entry point for a long position. The market sentiment around this company is so negative... Even good news puts them down further. It makes no sense. 

**Q4 Highlights -** 

* Beat Q4 EPS coming in at $1.19 vs estimated $1.12.
* They beat Q4 revenue estimates with $8.37 billion in revenue vs analyst estimates of $8.26 billion. This represents a 4% growth rate YoY in Q4 revenue. 
* Total payment volume (TPV) increased 7% YoY in Q4 to $437.8 billion. This was short of analyst estimates, although 7% is still significant growth. 
* Total active accounts increased by 2.1% to 434 million. 
* Venmo TPV rose 10%.

**Further Growth -** Venmo is growing very fast, adding 8.8 million accounts last year. Monthly active accounts for Venmo's debit card increased by 30% in the year. Also, Pay with Venmo monthly actives increased 20%. More and more merchants are accepting Venmo as payment like Starbucks, DoorDash, and Ticketmaster. The company announced a $15 billion dollar share repurchase program, in addition to the $4.86 billion still remaining. Expecting to repurchase $6 billion in 2025. 

**Conclusion -** I think this is an amazing company that is unloved by the market. It continues to grow revenues and other important things like TPV and active users. They are extremely focused on organic growth which I find is the best thing to do. Things like PayPal Everywhere are increasing brand identity which is critical to the success of the company. People left PayPal for dead, but it is being revived. The most recent dip presents a great entry point at **$77.73**. I really believe in this company and fully expect they will get back to around **$150-200** in due time.

investing,Thesis: Cardlytics (NYSE: CDLX),"Thesis: Cardlytics ($CDLX)

Over the last two years, I have, with my own eyes, witnessed investors completely lose their cool with Cardlytics, often finding themselves on the wrong side of the trade. The next section describes my thesis, the current concerns, and the potential upside.

Cardlytics (NASDAQ: CDLX) distributes card-linked offers via bank channels. If your primary bank is a top bank in the US, such as Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Truist, or PNC, you will most likely have seen offers on display that where powered by Cardlytics. However, you will not encounter any Cardlytics branding. Banks incorporate the Automated Delivery Engine (ADE) of Cardlytics into their user interface (UI) across mobile and desktop apps.

This creates the impression for the user that these offers are natively served directly from the bank What might sound more familiar to you are names like Chase Offers, Bank Amerideals, or Well Fargo Rewards. These are branded names by the banks, but in reality, they’re powered by the ADE from Cardlytics.

From the consumer’s perspective, the card-linked offers (CLOs) are redeemed and credited as follows: The consumer begins by activating the offer within their bank app or on the bank’s website. They then use their linked debit or credit card to make a purchase at the specified merchant within the offer’s 45-day period. Once the transaction is complete, the cashback reward is automatically credited to their account. Essentially, Cardlytics is giving consumers free money through offers they cannot find elsewhere on the goods and services they buy every day.

During 2023, the Cardlytics platform analysed approximately $4.7 trillion in purchases across all categories and geographies, both online and in-store. This covers an incredible one in two of all purchase transactions in the US. They currently have over 168 million monthly active users (MAUs) in the banking channel who saved more than $144 million on purchased items through CLOs.

From the advertiser’s point of view, CLOs in the bank channel powered by Cardlytics are powerful:

1. Cardlytics distributes offers in a brand-safe, verified banking environment, ensuring fraud-free exposure.
2. Offers are targeted precisely based on consumers’ actual spending habits. Starbucks, for example, can reach customers who frequently shop at nearby cafes but rarely at Starbucks
3. Performance can be measured with pinpoint precision. Controlled randomized trials on the actual spending data give real-time insights in to campaign ROI
4. Advertisers benefit from strong returns, typically generating $4 to $6 in incremental revenue for every dollar spent.

For banks, Cardlytics delivers clear value by offering a share of advertising revenue. Banks receive just over half of what advertisers pay, net of the consumer incentives provided to customers.

More importantly, consumers who engage with Cardlytics CLOs are higher card spenders, have higher revolving card balances, interact more frequently with the bank’s app, and show reduced churn rates. Together, these benefits provide banks with value that far exceeds the revenue share alone.

Since the high in February 2021, Cardlytics has suffered a 97% decline in value. Such a dramatic decline illustrates two things: the inefficiency of the stock market and some past and current limitations associated with Cardlytics’ business model. To understand these past and present limitations, we need to dive deeper into the company’s technology stack, its founders, and how the management team has evolved over time.

The company’s founders were bankers who understood the power of historical purchase data and the needs of marketers. While skilled at building banking relationships and recognising the power of purchase intelligence, none of the founders were technical or product masterminds. This meant that for the first 14 years of the company’s existence, there was no tech leadership in place that could drive  the innovation needed to keep up with modern advertising standards.

The initial technology stack of Cardlytics comprised two on-premises solutions: the Offer Placement System (OPS), which was often hosted within each financial institution (FI) partner’s data infrastructure, and the Offer Management System (OMS), hosted separately by Cardlytics. Thi s structure created significant limitations.

OPS ran on individual bank servers, requiring custom configurations for each FI’s systems and security needs. This meant updates had to be installed separately at each location, making changes slow and resource-intensive.

OMS, hosted by Cardlytics, handled campaign management but relied on OPS for execution. Since each bank’s OPS operated independently, data collection was fragmented and couldn’t provide the real-time analytics that advertisers wanted.

Not only was Cardlytics limited by its software architecture, but the user interface of the CLOs was also fairly basic. Essentially, company logos were displayed with a specified cashback discount.

The old UI could not serve ads for specific categories or items (stock-keeping units, or SKUs). Offers simply displayed a percentage discount, which, while not a major issue for consumers, posed a significant challenge for smaller advertisers with less brand awareness.

Without the brand recognition of a typical Fortune 500 company, these smaller advertisers require more customisation to create excitement and engagement around the offers they aim to market.

The reasons for this limitation are two-fold: first, the simple UI did not allow for more advanced descriptions of the CLOs. Second, the bank data only captures where someone shopped, not what they bought.

Consequently, advertisers with differentiated margins, such as mass merchants (e.g., Costco), gas stations (e.g., Circle K), and hardware stores (e.g., Lowe’s), can only make limited use of the channel due to concerns that offers may be used by consumers to purchase low-margin items. Additionally, the inability to design offers around specific categories or SKUs prevents manufacturers (e.g., Campbell’s or Black & Decker) from utilising the channel. In some verticals, such as grocery, this is a severe limitation, as in those channels, manufacturers capture most of the margin and provide the majority of advertising and discounting.

Keeping these limitations in mind, we must note that Cardlytics’ growth has been impressive. Since its founding, the company has achieved cumulative revenue growth of over +20%, reaching $309M in revenue by the end of 2023.

Fast forward to today, and Cardlytics has undertaken significant efforts to address these limitations:

**First,** Cardlytics developed a new cloud-based ad server hosted on AWS, replacing the old on-premises solution previously maintained within each FI’s infrastructure. The AWS server centralises ad management, allowing updates, features, and security enhancements to be deployed universally across all FIs, significantly improving speed and efficiency. Its microservice architecture enables agile development and elastic scaling to handle demand fluctuations, ensuring a seamless user experience and optimised resource use. Additionally, the AWS environment enhances data processing capabilities and offers top-tier security, supporting fast, data-driven insights for advertisers.

Currently, only BofA, Cardlytics’ largest client, remains on the legacy server, creating some revenue distortion as this older setup requires special attention to maintain. Former CEO Karim Temsamani explained that migrating BofA involves substantial tech changes, as 20% of the network is still on- premises. Most banks have already moved to the new ad server with positive feedback, enabling faster updates moving forward. Once this technical debt is resolved, the company will be better positioned to drive incremental revenue growth.

**Second,** the company has positioned itself to offer highly customized, data-driven advertising with its acquisition of Bridg in 2021 for $350 million, plus a substantial additional earnout. Bridg offers  a powerful customer data platform that enables advertisers to link in-store purchases to individual profiles by integrating point-of-sale (POS) data with its proprietary cookieless identity resolution technology.

This technology uses a combination of non-personally identifiable payment details, third-party datasets, data from other Bridg clients, and artificial intelligence to match consumer transactions with unique email identifiers.

These email addresses allow Bridg to track customer behavior over time, even for those not in loyalty programs, and create detailed audience segments based on longitudinal behavior patterns.

This capability has significant potential when combined with Cardlytics' extensive data on consumer card spending. As part of Cardlytics, Bridg can now enhance its match rate by leveraging Cardlytics' transaction data, giving Cardlytics a sustainable competitive advantage in accurately identifying and segmenting audiences. Through Bridg’s integrations into merchants’ POS systems, Cardlytics can now deliver highly targeted, SKU-level offers directly to individual customers.

A practical example of Bridg’s impact is its work with Chipotle. By analyzing transaction data, Bridg enabled Chipotle to identify how specific menu items, like queso, influenced customer return rates. This insight allowed Chipotle to make data-backed adjustments to its menu, leading to improved customer retention and loyalty.

Now, Bridg’s granular customer tracking and segmentation capabilities extend to Cardlytics’ advertisers, enabling them to deploy SKU-specific offers that resonate with precise customer preferences.

The addition of SKU-level targeting is a game-changer for Cardlytics. It allows Cardlytics to tap into broader shopper marketing budgets from brands like Unilever and Procter & Gamble, who require SKU-level targeting capabilities for high-value, product-specific promotions. Early trials of SKU-specific offers, such as promoting Hershey’s products to U.S. Bancorp customers at Rite Aid, have shown promising results, and banks are optimistic about the impact of this advanced targeting.

By enabling precise, SKU-based targeting, Cardlytics is positioned to accelerate its growth trajectory, differentiate itself from competitors, and provide a suite of capabilities that are both complex and costly for others to replicate.

Third, leadership changes have presented a short-term challenge, with three CEO appointments in three years, highlighting the need for stability. Karim Temsamani, brought in from Stripe to focus on product development, ultimately did not meet expectations. Amit Gupta, former General Manager of Bridg, has now stepped in as CEO, bringing a solid technical background and a clear sense of leadership, making him a promising choice. An even more impactful change is the addition of Peter Chan as CTO.

With experience at Yahoo in the early 2000s, a period known for producing top engineering talent, Peter’s expertise significantly strengthens Cardlytics’ technical capabilities. As you can see, significant improvements have been happening at Cardlytics. Fortunately for us, these changes have yet to be reflected in the business’s stock price performance. In the next section, I’ll address why the stock has been trading in a $3–$20 range over the past two years.

Multiple narratives have been pushing the stock in all directions. When I first bought a stake, one issue was the uncertainty around the Bridg earnout payouts; this was essentially a disagreement between Cardlytics and the previous owners of Bridg. If Cardlytics had been wrong in its view on the dispute, the company could have technically gone bankrupt. This issue has since been resolved in favour of Cardlytics, and near-term liquidity is now sufficient. Once signs emerged that this would be settled, the stock quickly rose to around $19. However, it dropped back to $5 in early 2024, until the announcement of American Express joining the channel. This news was significant and drove the stock back up to $20. On the first day it reached $20, then-CEO Karim announced a 5% equity raise, sending the stock 33% lower, a decision that was both unnecessary and poorly timed.

Fast forward to Q1 and Q2, and new issues began to emerge. With the new ad engine, there was a dramatic increase in the over-delivery and under-delivery of ad campaigns. This has caused challenges for Cardlytics because when too many redemptions occur i.e., a campaign performs much better than expected and exceeds the initial budget set by the advertiser, Cardlytics must cover the difference. For example, if an advertiser sets a $1M budget, and the campaign generates $1.2M in activations, Cardlytics is responsible for paying the extra $200K. Conversely, when a campaign underperforms, there is no financial liability, but it damages the relationship with advertisers. This is budget they intended to spend that is now going unused.

The main reasons for these issues are twofold:

1. The old infrastructure did not support real-time tracking of engagement with any given campaign

2. This caused pricing to be structured differently, with Cardlytics offering a traditional media-buying pricing model.

Under the Cost per Served Sale (CPS) model, Cardlytics charges a percentage on purchases that users make from an advertiser only if they were served the offer during the campaign period and subsequently made a purchase. This model means Cardlytics earns revenue based on actual purchases that occur after an ad is served, tying revenue to a conversion (purchase) event, not just ad exposure.

The “over-delivery” issue can occur in CPS if more users engage with and redeem offers than the budget anticipated, thus triggering higher-than-expected Consumer Incentive payouts that Cardlytics must cover if the campaign budget is exceeded.

To make things worse, Cardlytics only realises these discrepancies over 60 days after the campaigns are launched. This obviously is not very scalable and leads to suboptimal business outcomes across all time frames.

The good news is that significant progress has been made. As is often the case, the best improvements come from facing challenges. For Cardlytics, this has been no different. The issues of under- and over-delivery have driven the team to build out engagement-based pricing and develop the Dynamic Marketplace.

The Dynamic Marketplace is central to the engagement-based pricing strategy, allowing advertisers to actively manage campaigns on a daily basis. Advertisers can now adjust Return on Ad Spend (ROAS) goals, fees, and budgets mid-campaign, addressing over- and under-delivery in near real-time. With over 20 campaigns live on this platform, the Dynamic Marketplace is transforming campaign management from a static, set-and-forget process to a responsive, performance-driven experience.

The shift to Cost per Engagement (CPE) aligns Cardlytics’ offerings with industry standards, making it easier for advertisers accustomed to CPC-based pricing on platforms like Google or Facebook to transition. This approach provides advertisers with the pacing, visibility, and control needed for efficient budget use, directly linking ad costs to specific, measurable consumer actions. According to CFO Alexis DeSieno, 38% of total billings are now on engagement-based pricing models, with a goal of moving the majority to CPE by the end of 2025.

Short-term earnings volatility should be expected, given that 62% of billings still come from static campaigns. The end of 2025 is probably ambitious, as Cardlytics has a history of under-delivering on deadlines it has set. I’m willing to give management the benefit of the doubt, and I’m curious to see if they can deliver this on time.

I hope this section has given you better insight into the past and current limitations of Cardlytics. It’s important to understand these, as it will allow you to cut through the noise more effectively when reading about the business.

Now that we’ve discussed challenges and limitations, it’s time to shift towards the strengths and expected value of Cardlytics.

Firstly, when considering competitive advantage, Cardlytics would be nearly impossible for individual banks to replicate. Banks would always have smaller MAUs compared to a distributor who aggregates the whole market, thereby significantly enhancing the quality of advertisers on the platform. Cardlytics spent over $180 million on the advertising platform in 2023, and this investment is set to increase from this point onwards.

You have to keep in mind that this is not a one-off; Cardlytics has been building this platform for the last 16 years. There is a compounding effect to all the investments they have made to date. These factors make it, in my view, extremely unlikely that banks would ever drop Cardlytics. Often, banking bureaucracy is seen as a weakness to the Cardlytics investment thesis. I see it as the opposite. While it may seem frustrating, it’s actually a significant competitive advantage. When a bank chooses a certain direction, they almost always stick to it, creating a substantial moat for Cardlytics. Additionally, this makes it very difficult for new players to enter this niche market.

Returning to the idea of banks replicating what Cardlytics has built. Given their reduced reach, less mature technology, and limited experience, a bank attempting to build its own ad network without Cardlytics would almost certainly end up with fewer offers on its system for many years, if not indefinitely. This lack of content would not only mean less revenue for the bank but, more importantly, fewer secondary benefits (such as retention and increased cardholder spending) that come with a robust collection of offers.

You’ll remember that these secondary benefits are multiple times more valuable to a bank than its revenue share. So, depending on how much less productive a bank’s standalone effort would be, it’s possible the bank could end up worse off, even without considering the direct costs of duplicating Cardlytics’ infrastructure.

It should also come as no surprise that Cardlytics has never lost a banking partner where the initiative came from the bank’s side. Given the amount of value the ecosystem holds for all participants, it’s hard to envision a scenario where Cardlytics’ business materially deteriorates in the long term. This means that our downside is naturally well protected from a business perspective. Cardlytics is certainly leveraged from a financial standpoint, but once the business reaches positive FCF and scale, these issues should resolve without substantial dilution on the equity side.

At maturity, Cardlytics should be able to generate 15–20% net income margins (or more if they succeed in reducing the bank partner share over time). At 20x profits, these margins would make the business worth 3–4x revenue. Based on today’s revenue, fair value would be $1.2 billion, which represents substantial upside. However, a scenario of no growth is very unlikely given the amount of runway and market share potential. Execution will be crucial, as will the evolution of the advertising marketplace over time.

These factors will ultimately determine whether Cardlytics becomes a $5 billion or $50 billion market cap company.

Currently, Cardlytics is selling for 0.60x revenue. This implies the market has no confidence in Cardlytics’ ability to grow, completely discounting all the factors mentioned in our analysis. When you go up against “Mr Market,” you need to have strong reasons to believe you’re right and the market is wrong.

In the case of Cardlytics, the volatility and complexity of the channel can discourage many investors. Given the short-term focus of most market participants, Cardlytics is a difficult stock to hold.

Progress may be slow or appear slow for extended periods. This naturally discourages investors, who tend to extrapolate the past into the future on a linear scale. This is a significant mistake when analysing Cardlytics. Progress in any business is rarely linear, and given the nature of Cardlytics, you can expect even more asymmetry.

Currently, there are multiple catalysts that could make the next 12 to 24 months look materially different:

1. Onboarding of American Express: Management has mentioned a small trial that went live this quarter, which is expected to scale into next year.
2. Integration of Bridg and increasingly targeted offers: New advertisers are joining the platform from categories that historically have not been served.
3. Improvement in macroeconomic conditions with a Trump administration, which, generally speaking, is expected to be pro-business with lower taxes and fewer regulations!
4. Rollout of a self-service platform, which will allow for a much broader advertiser base to onboard on the platform.
5. Implementation of engagement-based pricing, which will remove short-term headwinds and resolve issues of over- or under-delivering campaigns.
6. Full transition of all FI partners to the new ad server, creating an additional tailwind for revenue.
7. Expansion into the UK: Monzo has been onboarded, and Lloyds is currently Cardlytics’ largest customer. There is tremendous potential in the UK, which could significantly increase MAU.

Once these catalysts materialise, you can expect substantial changes to the stock price. I wouldn’t be surprised if these factors all come into play simultaneously. While the road to maturity will take many years and will have its ups and downs, you’re likely feeling quite optimistic about the prospects of an investment in Cardlytics by now.

Assuming our reasoning proves correct, Cardlytics should have many years of significant growth ahead. Currently, it represents over 30% of my investment portfolio. Following the latest earnings report, I have added to my existing position. Cardlytics is positioning itself for sustainable, asymmetric growth—but only time will tell.","['SBUX', 'SBUX']",1,3,3,2025-02-05 00:23:45+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ihx20c/thesis_cardlytics_nyse_cdlx/,0.9999
investing,Can we trust chatgpt to calculate stock values?,"It's telling me Palantir is worth $3.76 per share right now. It also said that Nvidia is worth $1436.50 per share. Here's what it said for Palantir:

To estimate the intrinsic value of Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR) stock, we'll use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. This approach involves projecting the company's future free cash flows (FCF) and discounting them to their present value using the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC). Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. Gather Key Financial Data:

Free Cash Flow (FCF): For the trailing twelve months (TTM) ending September 30, 2024, Palantir reported a free cash flow of $980.32 million. 

Shares Outstanding: As of September 30, 2024, the company had approximately 2.27 billion shares outstanding. 

WACC: Palantir's WACC is estimated at 16.76%. 


2. Project Future Free Cash Flows:

We'll assume a conservative annual growth rate for FCF over the next five years. Given the company's recent performance and market conditions, a 10% annual growth rate is reasonable.

Year 1 FCF: $980.32 million × 1.10 = $1,078.35 million

Year 2 FCF: $1,078.35 million × 1.10 = $1,186.19 million

Year 3 FCF: $1,186.19 million × 1.10 = $1,304.81 million

Year 4 FCF: $1,304.81 million × 1.10 = $1,435.29 million

Year 5 FCF: $1,435.29 million × 1.10 = $1,578.82 million


3. Calculate the Terminal Value:

The terminal value represents the present value of all future free cash flows beyond Year 5, assuming a perpetual growth rate. We'll use a 3% perpetual growth rate and the Year 5 FCF.

Terminal Value (TV) at Year 5: $1,578.82 million × (1 + 0.03) / (0.1676 - 0.03) = $1,578.82 million × 1.03 / 0.1376 ≈ $11,741.68 million


4. Discount Future Cash Flows and Terminal Value to Present Value:

Using the WACC of 16.76%, we'll discount each year's FCF and the terminal value back to the present.

Discount Factor for Year 1: 1 / (1 + 0.1676)^1 ≈ 0.855

Discount Factor for Year 2: 1 / (1 + 0.1676)^2 ≈ 0.734

Discount Factor for Year 3: 1 / (1 + 0.1676)^3 ≈ 0.629

Discount Factor for Year 4: 1 / (1 + 0.1676)^4 ≈ 0.539

Discount Factor for Year 5: 1 / (1 + 0.1676)^5 ≈ 0.462

Discount Factor for Terminal Value: 1 / (1 + 0.1676)^5 ≈ 0.462


Now, calculate the present value (PV) of each cash flow and the terminal value:

PV of Year 1 FCF: $1,078.35 million × 0.855 ≈ $921.76 million

PV of Year 2 FCF: $1,186.19 million × 0.734 ≈ $870.77 million

PV of Year 3 FCF: $1,304.81 million × 0.629 ≈ $820.77 million

PV of Year 4 FCF: $1,435.29 million × 0.539 ≈ $773.77 million

PV of Year 5 FCF: $1,578.82 million × 0.462 ≈ $729.77 million

PV of Terminal Value: $11,741.68 million × 0.462 ≈ $5,419.68 million


5. Calculate the Total Present Value:

Sum the present values of the FCFs and the terminal value:

Total PV: $921.76 million + $870.77 million + $820.77 million + $773.77 million + $729.77 million + $5,419.68 million ≈ $8,536.52 million


6. Determine the Intrinsic Value per Share:

Divide the total present value by the number of shares outstanding:

Intrinsic Value per Share: $8,536.52 million / 2.27 billion ≈ $3.76


Conclusion:

Based on this DCF analysis, the estimated intrinsic value of Palantir's stock is approximately $3.76 per share. This suggests that the current market price of $102.59 per share is significantly higher than the calculated intrinsic value, indicating that the stock may be overvalued based on this model.

Please note that this is a simplified analysis. In reality, intrinsic value calculations involve more complex models and assumptions, including sensitivity analyses to account for uncertainties in growth rates, discount rates, and other factors. It's advisable to consult with financial advisors or conduct a more detailed analysis before making investment decisions.

investing,Tesla over valued should it be shorted?,"
Over the past few years, Tesla’s stock has been propelled by a narrative of future technological breakthroughs and visionary leadership. However, a closer look at the underlying fundamentals—and in particular a comparison with Chinese giant BYD—reveals several concerning points:
	
1.	Superior Sales and Market Penetration of BYD
	•	In 2022, BYD sold approximately 1.86 million new energy vehicles worldwide, compared with Tesla’s 1.31 million deliveries globally (with only about 440,000 delivered in China) [ ￼].
	
•	BYD’s sales figures reflect its diversified product portfolio—from affordable passenger EVs to commercial vehicles and buses—which has allowed it to capture a larger share of the rapidly expanding global market.
	
•	Prominent voices like Charlie Munger have even remarked that in China, “BYD is so much ahead of Tesla that it’s almost ridiculous,” noting that while Tesla has been forced to reduce prices repeatedly, BYD has maintained a pricing discipline that reinforces its quality perception [ ￼].
	
2.	Integrated Vertical Model and Proprietary IP
	•	BYD’s business model is built on deep vertical integration. It manufactures everything from battery cells (including its innovative blade battery) to complete battery packs, ensuring tighter quality control, faster innovation cycles, and cost efficiencies.
	
•	In contrast, Tesla’s battery strategy still depends heavily on external suppliers such as CATL, Panasonic, and LG Energy Solution. While Tesla touts its in-house 4680 cell as revolutionary, independent analysis shows that its energy density improvements (in Wh/kg) are modest compared to the rapid progress made by competitors [see discussion below].
	
•	BYD’s extensive R&D and robust portfolio of patents in battery technology (and its willingness to license technology to other automakers) suggest that its technological edge isn’t just hype—it translates into real, scalable production improvements. Tesla’s reliance on external providers leaves it vulnerable if those suppliers or competing integrated players (like BYD) drive down costs and improve performance.
	
3.	Limited Technological Differentiation on Core Battery Metrics
	
•	A key metric for EV performance is energy density (Wh/kg). Despite much fanfare around Tesla’s battery innovations, the improvements in energy density aren’t dramatically superior to those achieved by BYD and other leading manufacturers.
	
•	This calls into question whether Tesla’s premium valuation—built largely on future expectations—can be sustained if its core battery technology isn’t materially better. BYD, on the other hand, combines modest improvements in battery performance with a proven, fully integrated production process that has already translated into higher sales volumes and broader market acceptance.
	
4.	The Overvaluation Argument and Market Sentiment
	
•	Tesla’s current market valuation appears to be based on an almost irrational optimism about future robotaxis, autonomous driving, and energy storage breakthroughs—none of which have yet materially improved the company’s profitability or production volumes.
	
•	With BYD now not only supplying its own vehicles but also securing contracts as a battery supplier for other major players (including recent agreements where BYD’s FinDreams unit is set to supply Tesla’s Shanghai energy storage facility [ ￼]), the narrative that Tesla is the sole leader in battery innovation is weakening.
	
•	When you combine lower vehicle sales numbers, an overreliance on third-party suppliers, and only modest improvements in battery performance, the rationale behind Tesla’s high valuation starts to crumble. Investors may eventually reprice Tesla based on its current fundamentals rather than its lofty future projections.

Conclusion

From this perspective, the argument for shorting Tesla centers on the idea that:
	
•	BYD’s strong global sales, robust vertical integration, and advanced battery IP are not only outpacing Tesla in key markets (especially in China) but also provide a more sustainable competitive advantage.
	
•	Tesla’s reliance on external suppliers and its relatively modest improvements in core battery metrics (like energy density) suggest that its premium valuation is built on an overly optimistic narrative.
	
•	If market sentiment shifts away from these future promises and begins to focus on near-term fundamentals, Tesla could see a significant correction.

Fast forward to 2025, I’m 100% VOO (the S&P 500 ETF). Decided I was done with allocating percentages to overlapping funds, and playing single stocks. 

But now, after speaking with a FA, they recommended moving roughly 10% of my portfolio to possibly 1-2 volatile stocks with a lot of upside (companies like Palantir, Tesla, NVIDIA, ect)…not sure which I’d chose in the end. Although that could be a slippery slope of getting back into stock picking and playing with my portfolio.

* DeepSeek’s Disruptive Impact – DeepSeek’s AI model V3, trained on Nvidia’s H800 chips at a fraction of the usual cost, raises questions about the necessity of high-cost AI hardware, pressuring Nvidia’s pricing power.
* Financial and Competitive Pressures – Nvidia depends heavily on a few major tech companies, faces emerging competition from AMD, Broadcom, and DeepSeek, and has a valuation significantly above industry norms, making it vulnerable to market corrections.

* DeepSeek’s Disruptive Impact – DeepSeek’s AI model V3, trained on Nvidia’s H800 chips at a fraction of the usual cost, raises questions about the necessity of high-cost AI hardware, pressuring Nvidia’s pricing power.

Nvidia has established itself as a dominant force in the AI hardware industry, with its H100 and H800 chips powering some of the most advanced AI models, including ChatGPT and DeepSeek. The H100’s architecture enables AI models to train at unprecedented speeds, while the H800 variant meets regulatory requirements in markets like China. The evolution from the A100 to the H100 has significantly accelerated AI capabilities, with GPT-3 models learning four times faster than before. Nvidia’s market strength is reinforced by deep integration with tech giants like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft, ensuring continued demand for its products. As AI models become more sophisticated and data-intensive, Nvidia’s GPUs remain central to pushing the limits of what AI can achieve.

DeepSeek’s AI model V3 has disrupted the industry by achieving high-performance AI training on Nvidia’s H800 chips at significantly lower costs. Traditionally, training advanced AI models has required billions in investment, but DeepSeek’s approach challenges this assumption, demonstrating that high-level AI training can be done with minimal resources. This efficiency could lead major tech firms to question Nvidia’s high pricing, pressuring the company’s ability to maintain its premium margins. If DeepSeek’s success encourages more companies to seek cost-effective alternatives, Nvidia may need to justify its premium pricing or risk losing market share.

Despite its strong position, Nvidia’s financial foundation has key vulnerabilities. Nearly half of its data center revenue comes from a handful of major tech firms, including Microsoft and Meta—companies that are now investing in developing their own AI chips to reduce dependency on Nvidia. While Nvidia’s dominance in both software and hardware makes it difficult to replace, emerging competitors like AMD and DeepSeek are introducing cost-effective alternatives. DeepSeek, for example, trained its model with only $5 million, a fraction of the billions typically required for Nvidia-powered training. With a P/E ratio three times the industry average, Nvidia’s valuation remains highly sensitive to changes in AI spending and broader market trends. A slowdown in AI-related investments or increased competition could significantly impact Nvidia’s stock price.

For years, Nvidia was synonymous with AI growth, with investors believing that any advancement in AI would translate directly into gains for Nvidia. However, this perception is shifting. The emergence of cost-effective AI models and alternative chip suppliers, including DeepSeek, AMD, Google, and Amazon, challenges Nvidia’s “There Is No Alternative” (TINA) status. Concerns about pricing, licensing restrictions, and geopolitical factors, including U.S. government restrictions on chip exports, further complicate Nvidia’s outlook. Investors are increasingly questioning whether Nvidia can sustain its premium pricing in a market where competition is growing, leading to potential valuation recalibration.

The AI industry is undergoing rapid transformation, with cost-efficiency becoming a critical factor in decision-making. Nvidia’s high-end GPUs have long been the gold standard, but rising costs are prompting companies to explore alternatives. AMD’s MI300 series, for example, offers competitive AI processing power at lower costs, making it an attractive alternative for firms looking to diversify suppliers. Broadcom is also gaining traction in AI networking, while DeepSeek’s focus on affordable AI chips threatens Nvidia’s dominance. As these competitors gain market share, Nvidia’s ability to maintain its pricing power and market stronghold may diminish, forcing it to adapt to a changing landscape.

DeepSeek’s advancements have ripple effects across the AI supply chain. If AI training costs continue to drop, tech giants may slow down their AI-related capital expenditures, impacting Nvidia’s growth trajectory. Furthermore, the shift toward more cost-efficient AI solutions could reduce demand for Nvidia’s high-end chips, altering market priorities from premium performance to affordability. This evolving landscape presents both risks and opportunities for Nvidia. While it may face increased competition, Nvidia’s leadership in AI infrastructure and software solutions still gives it a competitive edge. However, it must adapt to changing market demands to sustain long-term growth.

Nvidia’s market dominance is being challenged as the AI industry evolves. The rise of DeepSeek, along with increased competition from AMD, Broadcom, and major tech firms developing in-house chips, raises concerns about Nvidia’s pricing power and long-term growth. Recent market shifts have already led to a $600 billion drop in Nvidia’s market value, the largest single-day loss in U.S. stock history.

If the AI market prioritizes efficiency over expansion, Nvidia could see reduced demand for its high-end GPUs. However, its history of innovation, strong AI infrastructure, and ongoing R&D investments position it well to adapt. While some analysts view recent market dips as a buying opportunity, the competitive pressures and changing industry dynamics mean Nvidia must continue evolving to maintain its leadership in AI hardware.

# TL;DR: Nvidia remains a dominant force in AI hardware, but emerging competitors like DeepSeek, AMD, and Broadcom are challenging its pricing power and market dominance. DeepSeek’s AI model demonstrates that high-performance AI training can be achieved at significantly lower costs, potentially reshaping the AI ecosystem. Nvidia’s dependence on a few tech giants and its high valuation make it vulnerable to market shifts, while increasing competition suggests that its long-term growth may face headwinds. However, Nvidia’s innovation and market leadership still offer strong potential, provided it adapts to the evolving AI landscape.

While some analysts view recent market dips as a buying opportunity, the competitive pressures and changing industry dynamics mean Nvidia must continue evolving to maintain its leadership in AI hardware.

# TL;DR: Nvidia remains a dominant force in AI hardware, but emerging competitors like DeepSeek, AMD, and Broadcom are challenging its pricing power and market dominance. DeepSeek’s AI model demonstrates that high-performance AI training can be achieved at significantly lower costs, potentially reshaping the AI ecosystem. Nvidia’s dependence on a few tech giants and its high valuation make it vulnerable to market shifts, while increasing competition suggests that its long-term growth may face headwinds. However, Nvidia’s innovation and market leadership still offer strong potential, provided it adapts to the evolving AI landscape.","['NVDA', 'NVDA', 'MSFT', 'AMZN', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'AMD', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'MSFT', 'AMZN', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'AMZN', 'MSFT', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'MSFT', 'META', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'AMD', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'AMD', 'AMZN', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'AMD', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'AMD', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'AMD', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'AMD', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'AMZN', 'MSFT', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'MSFT', 'META', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'AMD', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'AMD', 'AMZN', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'AMD', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'AMD', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'AMD', 'NVDA', 'NVDA']",0,3,3,2025-02-03 02:17:01+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1igef02/nvda_deepseeks_disruption_and_the_changing_tech/,0.9995

investing,Dollar General: Undervaluation Poses Great Long-term Value,"Dollar General faces rising costs, supply issues, and theft, squeezing margins. Trading at 2017 lows, its expansion in underserved markets supports long-term growth, making it a strong buy opportunity for investors.

\*I do not own any shares at this time

# Macro Overview:

# Retail Sector Trends

In recent years, the discount retail sector has faced significant pressure. Discount retailers like Dollar General, Dollar Tree and Five Below have been experiencing rising costs leading to margins being squeezed. Supply chain constraints and wage increases have contributed mightily to profitability deterioration.

While the discount retail sector undergoing challenges, large retailers like Walmart, Costco, and Amazon have flourished. Inflation continues to play a significant role despite declining significantly from its June 2022 peak of 9.1%. As inflation remains above the Federal Reserve’s 2% target, the discount retail sector will continue to face pressure.

# Rising Shrink and Inventory Losses

Shrink, the industry term for theft, have contributed to billions of losses each year across the retail industry. According to Capital One Research, stores lost $121.6 billion to retail theft in 2023 with projections indicating shoplifting could cost retailers $143 billion in 2025.

In particular, Dollar General noted in their Q3 earnings report that shrink was a major reason for margin compression. As a result, self-checkout has been removed in some stores and converted to assisted checkout. High employee turnover across the industry has lead many stores to be understaffed further exacerbating shrink concerns.

# Tariff implementation

President Trump recently announced he would place 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico as well as 10% tariffs on goods from China effective February 1st. If officially implemented, this will dramatically impact the U.S. economy, consumer spending, and the entire retail sector. Retailers will likely increase costs on thousands of goods. This comes at a time when consumers have already cut back.

Take Dollar General for example. Price-sensitive consumers are their bread and butter so to speak. Further increases will deter them even more so than they have already been in recent years. Consumables account for 82.9% of Dollar General’s Q3 sales. With such heavy reliance on this segment, increased tariffs may hurt margins even further.

# Investment Thesis:

Short-term pressure has caused a steep decline in profitability metrics with low single-digit growth. Despite this, Dollar General remains a strong brand with an established presence in rural America. What separates them from their competition, is the niche audience they serve, where other retailers are not available. This strategy bodes well for them in undeserved markets regardless of the economic outlook. They may continue to face margin erosion in the short-term but their footprint in the U.S. and market appeal remains in tact.

# Key Drivers

* **Expansion Strategy & Project Elevate:** Dollar General remains focused on the future after their Q3 results. For fiscal year ending January 30, 2026 (fiscal year 2025), 4,885 real estate projects are expected. This includes approximately 575 new stores, with 15 in Mexico. Also in Q3, “Project Elevate” was announced. The plan includes expanding their store remodel program to approximately 2,250 stores and the relocation of 45 stores. Same-store sales increased by 1.3% indicating current stress may be showing signs of improvement. Cash & equivalents grew by 47% to $537.26 million compared to net debt of $5.72 billion which declined by -16.4%.
* **Current Valuation:** As of January 29, 2025, the stock has a current price of $72.04, its lowest levels since late 2017. As you can see below from the charts via MacroTrends, Dollar General’s stock has declined substantially in the 1-year period as well as the 5-year period by -44.9% and -51.1% respectively. This has resulted in a P/E ratio of just 11.70, significantly below their 5-year average of 20.1. Dollar General has declined significantly yet they still pay a strong dividend with a yield of 3.3% adding to the attractiveness as well as the clear undervaluation.

# Conclusion

The recent significant declines in Dollar General’s stock positions them to be at their lowest share price since 2017. Ironically, the company has grown from $21.99 billion to $38.69 billion, an increase of 75% in those eight years. Short-term headwinds have created serious pressures on the company in recent years. Inflation first reached elevated levels. Now, it remains stubborn. Profitability has decreased substantially. Despite this, the increase in revenue and persistence in expansion has not stopped Dollar General from charging ahead.

# Risk Factors:

* **Competitive Pressures:** Walmart continues to invest billions in e-commerce, curbside pickup, and grocery delivery. Dollar General only offers these services at select locations and typically do not offer same-say delivery for groceries like Walmart. Walmart uses its supplier network and distribution effectively. This strategy allows them to offer lower prices on many essential goods that can undercut Dollar General. Dollar General has made notable strides in e-commerce and curbside pickup options, Walmart’s infrastructure is vastly superior.
* **Regulatory & Tariff Risk:** On February 1st, 2025, President Trump signed an executive order. The order issues tariffs for goods coming into the U.S from Canada, Mexico, and China. While it is unclear when the tariffs will take effect, it is certain they will impact consumers significantly. The possibility of them being lifted remains unknown. Consumables in particular account for the vast majority of total sales. According to Third Way, grocery items are projected to increase by 15% as a result of tariffs. If that analysis is correct, the increased costs will primarily affect Dollar General’s customers the worst as they tend to be the most cost-conscious.","['WMT', 'AMZN', 'WMT', 'WMT', 'WMT', 'WMT']",1,1,1,2025-02-02 16:47:01+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ig1ffv/dollar_general_undervaluation_poses_great/,0.9919

investing,Best way to hedge against powerful and cheap AI taking out jobs?,"I'm currently working as software engineer. I'm quite scared that AI will became powerful and cheap enough to take almost all white-collar jobs.

I'm thinking about the best way to hedge about it. NASDAQ-100 or particular AI-oriented companies seems to be the best way to go. I'm not sure if this is the way though.

If the AI becomes cheap and powerful - it will be easy for any start-up to create its own version of it. A lot of knowledge about AI is not really a secret and the know-how can spread with people changing jobs.

In such world companies like Microsoft can lose a lot, because it will be super easy to create copies of their software. If AI will be cheap enough - the demand for cloud computing will drop.

Demand for Nvidia products may fall as well (or stop rising).

I feel like we saw a sneak-peak of such scenario on Monday due to Deepseek.

Do you think these points are valid or maybe completely delusional? Maybe we won't stop with AI development and continue developing it, so it will be able to invent solutions to world problems on it's own?

investing,"I have a good amount of inheritance money, I need some advice","My mother passed when I was 7, she had been saving up for my future car ever since I was born and had accumulated 7 grand for me that I received when I had turn 16. I saved up my own money and my dad gave me an extra 2k to get a Volkswagen Passat, and has aggressively to pay my insurance until I graduate. Along with the car money she saved, she also saved a college fund for me of about 6 grand that im currently using for in state community college and probably will be able to fully pay off by the end of my two years at the school. Now that I’ve mostly painted the picture of my current expenses already being taking care of besides property tax and gas, her life insurance money is about 60,000 grand that my uncle has been keeping for me inside of a vanguard account. It was 100,000 grand, but my uncle used 30k to pay for the funeral I believe, and gave 40k to my dad who originally intended for me to have it, but due to family issues and quarantine, he ended up using it to get out of our bad living situation at the time, so that side of the money is gone, but the 30k my uncle had has been sitting in a vanguard for pretty much my entire life after she passed and now like I said is 60k. I’ve already been using the stock market with my tuition and work money while I’ve been accepting financial aid and only have sold Nvidia for 300 gross profit with my dads help, so I already have some experience with index funds. The main dilemma is that my mother insisted for me to have her inheritance when I’m 21 and while I’ve already talked to my uncle about it, I’ve been hesitating being persistent about it, since for one im new to the market, and the other reason being going against one of my mothers dying wishes. Over the 11 years that money has been in Vanguard and it has safely doubled and I’m grateful for that, but I know it’s not going to increase that much over the next four years, so should I persist and ask, or should I wait until I’m 21 like my mother wanted. Also if anyone has any other suggestions to what they would do with that amount of money besides investing in the stock market, or even hedge funds, im all ears for anything besides crypto.

investing,DeepSeek Hasn’t Deep-Sixed Nvidia,"**Here is my understanding of the DeepSeek breakthrough and its repercussions on the AI ecosystem**

DeepSeek used “Time scaling” effectively, which allows their r1 model to think deeper at the inference phase. By using more power instead of coming up with the answer immediately, the model will take longer to research for a better solution and then answer the question better than existing models.

**How did the model get to that level of efficiency?**

DeepSeek used a lot of interesting and effective techniques to make better use of its resources, and [this article from NextPlatform ](https://www.nextplatform.com/2025/01/27/how-did-deepseek-train-its-ai-model-on-a-lot-less-and-crippled-hardware/)does an excellent job with the details.

Besides effective time scaling the model distilled the answers from other models including ChatGPT’s models.

**What does that mean for the future of AGI, AI, ASI, and so on?**

Time scaling will be adopted more frequently, and tech leaders across Silicon Valley are responding to improve their methods - not like they have a choice. Databricks' CEO's phone hasn't stopped ringing, and Microsoft is already offering r1 as part of Azure. That is the logical and sequential next step – for AI to be any good, it was always superior inference that was going to be the differentiator and value addition.

Time scaling can be done at the edge as the software gets smarter.

However, more difficult solutions such as drug discovery will naturally require greater resources and the cloud.

**If the software gets smarter, will it require more GPUs?**

I believe GPU requirements will not diminish because you need GPUs for training and time scaling, smarter software will still need to distill data that has been trained. Nvidia's Blackwells are also touting 40% Total Cost Reductions for that much power, they are aiming for efficiency and better cost.

Cheaper LLMs are not a plug-and-play replacement. They will still require significant investments and expertise to train and create an effective inference model. Just as a number aiming at a 10x reduction in cost is a good target, but it will likely compromise quality and performance. Eventually, the lower-tier market will get crowded and commoditized – democratized if you will, which may require cheaper versions of hardware and architecture from AI chip designers, as an opportunity to serve lower-tier customers.

**Inferencing**

Over time, yes inference will become more important – Nvidia has been talking about the scaling law, which diminishes the role of training and the need to get smarter inference for a long time. They are working on this as well, I even suspect that the $3,000 Digits they showcased for edge computing will provide some of the power needed.

**Reducing variable costs per token/query is huge:** The variable cost will reduce, which is a huge boon to the AI industry, previously retrieving and answering tokens cost more than the entire monthly subscription to ChatGPT or Gemini.

**From Gavin Baker on X on APIs and Costs: (emphasis mine)**

>

**On training costs and real costs:**

>

**The NextPlatform too expressed doubts about DeepSeek’s resources**

>

A schedule of geographical revenues for Nvidia’s Q3-FY2025 showed over $4Bn revenue “sold” to Singapore, with the caveat that it may not be the ultimate destination, which also creates doubts that DeepSeek may have gotten access to Nvidia’s higher-end GPUs despite the US export ban or stockpiled them before the ban. 

**Better software and inference is the way of the future**

As one of the AI vendors at CES told me, she had the algorithms to answer customer questions and provide analytical insides at the edge for several customers – they have the data from their customers and the software, but they couldn’t scale because AWS was charging them too much for cloud GPU usage when they didn’t need that much power. So besides r1’s breakthrough in AGI, this movement has been afoot for a while, and this will spur investment and innovation in inference. 

However I strongly believe that there is still a humongous amount of training still to be done for high-quality AI, and that will remain an ongoing process.

We will continue to see demand for high-end Blackwell GPUs to train data and create better models for at least the next 18 months to 24 months after which the focus could shift to inference and as Nvidia’s CEO said, 40% of their GPUs are already being used for inference.","['NVDA', 'MSFT', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'NVDA']",0,7,6,2025-01-30 21:35:30+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1idy85s/deepseek_hasnt_deepsixed_nvidia/,0.992

Micron has cyclical weaknesses - The consumer NAND business faced challenges due to inventory reductions, seasonal slowdowns, and delayed PC refresh cycles, which impacted Q2 revenue guidance and margins.

Why can’t we find any article produced by any reputable financial sources, that discuss the significance of these achievements? There is essentially zero market news about it. China is right behind the USA in quantum computing research, and the market has no fucking clue.

I cannot share images on r/investing. You can refer to my profile for further analysis of specific stocks.

Check out D-Wave stock prices, for example. Given a large part of their business model relies in part on how they contribute to research in the field, they should be negatively impacted by major research developments in competing economies. Google’s Willow breakthrough rallied quantum computing stocks and Nvidia’s CEO pushed them back down. However, their stock prices did not move on 6/12 and 16/12 (corresponding with news releases of China's developments), suggesting that China’s developments have had no impact.

How about Quantum Computing Inc (QUBT)? It tells a similar story. Their focus is on fabrication of photonic quantum computing components – and again, providing researchers access to quantum computing technology. It looks like Google’s Willow breakthrough rallied stocks, and Nvidia’s CEO pushed them back down. Again, China’s developments have had zero impact.

How about IBM? News about Google’s Willow pushed their price down some 3%, which makes good sense. Willow’s performace blew that of IBM’s September R2 Heron processor out of the water. Willow is a competitor, but IBM’s position in the market means they are diversified in so much more than just quantum computing. A small bearish reaction makes perfect sense. So when Tianyan-504 reportedly challenged IBM's benchmarks just three days before Willow did, why didn’t the stock price move?

You can look at SkyWater Technologies (SKYT), and at Global Foundries (GFS), and Rigetti (RGTI), Alphabet (GOOGL), Intel (INTC), TSM (TSM), Keysight Technologies (KEYS), and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). Every one of these key companies relevant to advancing quantum computing in the Western World have one thing in common. When China announces their developments, the markets appear to stay still.

There are three possible reasons for this that I have come up with. There may be other reasons as well that I am not aware of, in which case I encourage you to enlighten me.

The first possible reason is as above: The market is generally not aware. It is likely that some players in the market are aware, and this is a simple piece of information that such players will be taking advantage of – they do not have incentive to highlight this knowledge. Furthermore, the market may be uniquely slow to react. Unlike DeepSeek, which we can physically interact with, breaking records in quantum computing research is less tangible, less sensational. Breaking news, markets are irrational.

The second possible reason is simple: China may be lying. I can not find any evidence to support this idea, and China’s past claims about quantum computing, such as those about [Jiuzhang](https://asiatimes.com/2023/10/china-unveils-faster-light-based-quantum-computer/), have been demonstrably true.

The third possible reason is that China’s quantum computers are not as technically advanced as they sound. Originally I wanted to follow with a full technical discussion about the recent history of Chinese Quantum computing, and the merits of Tianyan-504 and Zuchongzhi 3.0 in comparison to western quantum computing efforts. But since I am not a subject matter expert, and I do not have the time to write in full depth. But I will provide a bit more technical information, summarise and provide references to the academic research for relevant breakthrough technologies, so you can read for yourself.

China is fighting to lead the global race in quantum computing, and [the Chinese government has been investing tens of billions of dollars into quantum computing research](https://thequantuminsider.com/2023/04/13/chinese-quantum-companies-and-national-strategy-2023/), alongside the investments of Chinese institutions and corporations.

In 2020 [Jiuzhang, developed at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), was the second quantum computer in the world to achieve quantum supremacy](https://asiatimes.com/2023/10/china-unveils-faster-light-based-quantum-computer/), and the first photonic quantum computer to do so. Since then, the university has gone on to create further models of Jiuzhang, and develop chips with greater qubit lifetime and fidelity.

In April 2024, The Center for Excellence in Quantum Information and Quantum Physics developed their [Xiaohong superconducting chip](https://english.news.cn/20240425/a95b3c190a59486886f4cddc0def31cd/c.html), their most advanced to date, anticipated to reach the chip performance levels of main international cloud-enabled quantum computing platforms such as IBM’s Heron in key performance metrics including qubit lifetime (how long a qubit can hold its quantum state) and readout fidelity (accuracy in extracting information from qubits). I note the market did not appear to react to the Xiaohong chip either.

On the 13^(th) of November 2024,[ IBM announced their Quantum Heron R2](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/blog/qdc-2024), achieving their goal of running quantum circuits with up to 5,000 two-qubit gates, demonstrating advancements in in qubit lifetime and readout fidelity.

On the 6^(th) of December 2024, [Tianyan-504 was announced](https://english.cas.cn/newsroom/cas_media/202412/t20241206_893281.shtml), developed by China Telecom Quantum Group (CTQG) in partnership with the Chinese Academy of Sciences and QuantumCTek Co., Ltd., and, built on the Xiaohong chips. China is now the only country to achieve quantum computational advantage through both photonics and superconducting quantum computing technologies. This quantum computer will be incorporated into their quantum computing cloud platform, and made available for researcher purposes.

On the 9^(th) of December, [Google’s Willow was announced](https://blog.google/technology/research/google-willow-quantum-chip/). What makes Willow exceptional, is that it provides a breakthrough solution to quantum computing’s fidelity issue. It exponentially reduces the amount of error while adding more qubits. Presumably Willow can now be scaled further, and I expect to see further developments with adding more qubits now that this challenge has been solved.

Two weeks later, on the 16^(th) of December 2024, an entirely separate research team with the China Telecom Quantum Group (CTQG) in partnership with the Chinese Academy of Sciences and QuantumCTek Co., Ltd. [announced their Zuchongzhi 3.0](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.11924v1#S1). This superconducting quantum computer makes numerous advancements, and demonstrates quantum advantage through speed. It crushes benchmarks set by Google’s older Sycamore - “Compared to Google’s latest experiment, SYC-67 and SYC-70  the classical simulation cost of our 83-qubit, 32-cycle experiment is six orders of magnitude higher.” Though Zuchongzhi 3.0 does not demonstrate the error correction capability that Willow does, their creators have commented that they believe they can replicate the same techniques in a matter of months.

Quantum computing is still twenty years away from being relevant, they say. That gives lots of time for China to catch up. And from what I can understand, China is just one breakthrough away. There are other questions, such as China’s chip manufacturing capabilities, supply chains for components, that I am unable to find good information on. The US is doing what they can politically, through trade regulation, and restricting financial investment in China’s technologies. China already has the [lead in quantum communications, and potentially in quantum sensing](https://itif.org/publications/2024/09/09/how-innovative-is-china-in-quantum/). But China holds one massive advantage: it’s regime. In contrast to the American model, where corporations closely guard their own secrets from eachother, [China is claims they invest 15 billion of dollars into coordinated, cohesive research.](https://itif.org/publications/2024/09/09/how-innovative-is-china-in-quantum/) And it is showing in their results.

Each advancement that China makes in developing its quantum computing capability, ought to remind the market that there is a risk that the lead the US enjoys in quantum computing is being threatened. But look at those google search results again. Outside of technical circles, the western media simply hasn't picked it up. Look at what happened with DeepSeek. I think the markets just don't know. Investors are already anxious about their investments in quantum computing, and are starting to demand returns. Manufacturers are reluctant to scale component production, given the low demand and potential for volatility. So when the market does find out about China’s achievements in quantum computing, what's going to happen?

I know some of you have probably heard about this juicy rumor floating around that Tesla might be looking at acquiring $QS and if you haven't, well its out there and Elon just stated the reason why on todays earnings call.

Elon said - ""Right now, the constraint we're trying to solve is battery production, rather than demand."" So you know they're sweating bullets over their battery issues, working overtime to fix this shit.

Now, the issue is that Elon Musk has historically been content with lithium-ion batteries for Tesla's vehicles, citing the cost implications of adopting solid-state technology at scale. So in order for this rumor to come true and for QS to send us regards (myself included) to the multi-millionaire club, QS must be able to have a revolutionary solid-state Lithium battery AND be able to show that these batteries can be mass-produced cheaply at a large scale.

Just to be crystal clear: THIS IS A SUPER HIGH RISK play because there is a chance that $QS won't be able to figure out how to make these batteries affordable. As always, do your DD before you buy. 

Volkswagen has already made significant investments into $QS, but who the tf wants to drive an electric VW loaded with top-of-the-line revolutionary batteries anyways?

investing,Sailpoint - First SaaS IPO of 2025,"Sailpoint stands to be the first SaaS IPO of 2025.

It has some factors in its favor but overall I am bearish here.

Here is what I think they have going for them…

They are in a growing market. The shift to hybrid work and digital everything makes identity security even more critical. SailPoint has been quietly expanding into new areas like automation and AI-driven security, which should keep it relevant 

They have good NRR (net revenue retention). With identity security being sticky, SailPoint’s dollar-based net retention (likely in the 115% range, though they don’t explicitly say) means existing customers are growing their spend and churn is relatively low.

Anecdotally their GTM executives (Wendy Wu on marketing and Gary Nafus on sales) I have heard at talks and seem pretty sharp. 

But here are my major concerns…

They are still bleeding annually. SailPoint’s $395M in losses last fiscal year is not great. A SaaS IPO is tough in today’s market unless you can tell a compelling “path to profitability” story. SailPoint’s losses are improving, but investors are going to demand more.

At an $8B valuation, SailPoint is pricing itself like a premium SaaS player (assuming their growth rate thats like a 10x+ multiple). But today’s market doesn’t have the same appetite for high-multiple IPOs as a few years ago. Lemkin of SaaStr has good analysis on how the SaaS IPO markets have changed. 

Their market positioning with enterprise puts them head to head with major competitors. Cybersecurity is hot, but it’s also crowded. Okta, Ping, Microsoft… there are plenty of heavyweights in identity and access management. SailPoint’s differentiation (automation, AI) has to prove it’s enough to fend off bigger players.

investing,NVDA: Buying the Dip Amid DeepSeek AI and the AI Race,"

* **DeepSeek's Claims:** Released AI models (R1 and R1 Zero) claiming OpenAI-level performance with lower costs and less advanced chips, causing semiconductor stocks to drop.
* **Scalability Concerns:** Experts doubt whether DeepSeek’s approach can scale to meet the demands of growing AI adoption.
* **U.S. Export Ban:** Restrictions on advanced chip exports to China have spurred innovation but limit scaling and next-gen model development.
* **AI Adoption Still Early:** AI applications in industries like transportation, medicine, and home automation remain nascent, requiring advanced chips for growth.
* **Nvidia’s Strong Position:** Despite short-term stock dips, Nvidia’s dominance in GPUs and projected growth (EBITDA from $34.5B in 2024 to $166.8B in 2027) highlight its long-term potential.
* **Investment Case:** Continued demand for high-performance chips ensures Nvidia’s relevance in the expanding AI market.

Nvidia is currently navigating a challenging landscape as DeepSeek, a company specializing in AI models, has unveiled its DeepSeek R1 and R1 Zero models. These models claim to rival OpenAI's performance at significantly lower training costs, just $6 million, using less advanced chips. The announcement has sent shockwaves through the semiconductor industry, leading to declining stock prices for companies like Nvidia. DeepSeek's claims suggest a potential shift in AI development priorities, focusing on cost-efficiency rather than the procurement of high-end chips. However, experts remain skeptical about the scalability of this approach. As AI adoption grows, so will the need for advanced chips capable of handling increased query volumes and more complex use cases.

The U.S. export ban on high-end chips to China has added another layer of complexity to the situation. While the ban aims to limit China's access to advanced technology, it may have inadvertently spurred innovation, forcing companies like DeepSeek to achieve more with less. Despite this, scaling AI models and developing next-generation solutions still require significant computational power, which advanced chips uniquely provide. With each GPU generation, improvements in power efficiency and performance become essential for addressing growing demand, particularly as AI applications expand across industries like transportation, medicine, and home automation.

AI adoption is still in its infancy, with significant growth potential across various sectors. Autonomous vehicles, for instance, represent less than 0.002% of the global car fleet, highlighting the vast untapped opportunities for AI-driven technologies. Similarly, the use of AI in medical research, molecular science, and household appliances remains limited, indicating substantial room for expansion. As these applications evolve, they will require a robust supply of advanced chips to achieve cost-effective scalability and enhanced efficiency. Even with advancements in cost-efficient training methods, scaling AI adoption to meet global demand will depend on continued investment in high-performance chips.

Nvidia remains well-positioned to benefit from this dynamic. While its stock has faced short-term pressure, the company's dominance in the GPU market and its projected growth underscore its long-term potential. Analysts estimate Nvidia's EBITDA to grow from $34.5 billion in 2024 to $166.8 billion by 2027, with free cash flow rising at a similar pace. This growth justifies Nvidia's premium valuation and positions it as a critical player in the AI-driven future. The competition spurred by DeepSeek and similar initiatives ultimately reinforces the need for advanced chips, ensuring Nvidia's relevance and profitability in the evolving AI landscape.

**TL;DR:** Despite DeepSeek's claims of cost-effective AI model training with less advanced chips, Nvidia's leadership in the GPU market and the growing demand for advanced chips to scale AI applications make it a compelling long-term investment opportunity.","['NVDA', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'NVDA']",0,5,3,2025-01-27 23:54:54+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ibo397/nvda_buying_the_dip_amid_deepseek_ai_and_the_ai/,0.9981
investing,The irony of the NVDA drop and reaction is ironic when you consider that it already happened before.,"Let me tell you a story...  It will have a point and I will give my investment ideas, but I need to establish the context first.

I used to be in the Tech Industry. For all intensive purposes I retired about a decade ago. My claim to fame was being speaker, trainer and consultant using Web technologies. Yes the original Web, which I started developing for in 95. 

I was just starting to work out of University as an IT consultant for UBS then SBG. My boss was tasked with figuring out this WWW thingy for the bank. I was there and thought, this is cool. As I dug into Netscape and Java (with a big J) I learned that this Web stuff could be really cool. I created in 96 a stock trading application using Microsoft OLE technologies embedded into Netscape with an Apache CGI backend. This was presented at a Swiss IEEE Data Highway conference (go ahead and check if you don't believe). I bought a Sun pizza box had a dedicated Internet connection in my apartment and wrote server extensions for Apache using the new CGI technology.

I am explaining the background because it allowed me to speak about Web and Java development in Silicon Valley at SD Conferences. I also attended the one and only Netscape developers conference. I was tasked by my boss to meet up with the Netscape folks to talk about making a browser deal with UBS. Here is where things became interesting.

As I was sitting in the imprunto meeting with Netscape I sensed they did not give a rats ass that UBS wanted 25,000 licenses of Netscape. The guy said, ""yeah we don't really want to deal with you because Deutsche Telekom wants a million licenses"".  I was a bit shocked and then indicated to them that I will take that information back to UBS. I also at the time asked about the Netscape Browser and the OLE interface. They said, ""yeah ignore that its Microsoft technologies and they are old school, you should learn Java and focus on that."" As I listened to the various sessions and the conceit I thought yeah this was the peak, everything will go downhill from here. 

I was convinced by that because as I was speaking at the various conferences in Silicon Valley I noticed a pattern. Silicon Valley people are arrogant as hell and they like to circle jerk each other. Meaning if you are not part of Silicon Valley you are nothing. For only the best work in Silicon Valley at least in their minds. 

Ok so now lets into the current situation and what I think will happen. Sun, Netscape and so on lost the thread when they focused on high end combining it with their arrogance. Sun boxes and Netscape were extremely expensive. They lost to Apache, PHP, and MySQL. They lost to an open source guy called Linus Torvals who was hacking out in Finnland!

The irony that a Chinese developer sitting in China has done a Linux is absolutely hilarious. When I see the Techbros and their financiers like Marc Andressen losing AGAIN you just have to chuckle. Remember Andressen was the loser in Netscape. 

But all is not lost because now the fun begins. When the dot com world collapsed onto itself we began to develop real web applications. Microsoft which was ignored by Netscape, released something called XMLHttpRequest object which made the Web of today possible. Those were the real glory days of Web after the dot com collapse.

So what does that mean for investing? Simple, essentially the entire dot com leaders collapsed and do not exist anymore. The exception being CSCO, but it was a long and hard road. What came out we didn't know at the time. However we do know the companies that thrived were the ones who used the WWW technology to offer a product. Think mapping, think social media, think google mail.

My main play would be ARM as they provide hardware that is cheap, efficient and could be scaled. Intel was not immediately as good as SPARC, but the Linux folks fixed that. I also think you need to look at companies that use AI to deliver a product. I am not talking about a chat bot. I am thinking something that offers a service to the retail that is something you want. And no I am not talking about Microsoft and its code pilot. I think it would be a mobile player. I am even thinking it could be somebody that has augmented glasswear stuff. You wear some glasses and have AI giving you information based on your actions.

I am not arguing that DeepSeek will win. On the contrary who knows if they will win, and it does not matter. What matters is that DeepSeek showed that the Silicon Valley argument of more hardware, more billions and more energy is pure and utter BS! A Chinese Open Source Developer proved that. There will be others that will do the exact same because we know we can. That is what should make Silicon Valley absolutely petrified and make you step away from the leaders with a ten foot pole.","['MSFT', 'MSFT', 'MSFT', 'INTC', 'MSFT']",0,57,32,2025-01-27 22:15:55+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1iblt6n/the_irony_of_the_nvda_drop_and_reaction_is_ironic/,0.981
investing,The Market Is Dropping After Huge AI Breakthrough—But Isn’t This Great News?,"Today, news broke about a revolutionary AI model that’s open-source, extremely powerful, and developed with far fewer resources than ever before. This should be cause for celebration—it’s a major step forward for global productivity. Yet, the stock market is responding with a significant sell-off.

Tech-heavy companies like NVIDIA and TSMC are seeing double-digit drops (around 17%), and the broader tech sector is down \~5%. For those of us holding global index funds, this means a drop in value, as these companies carry significant weight. But here’s the puzzling part: shouldn’t this kind of breakthrough *increase* the long-term value of the total market?

Cheaper and more accessible AI means businesses across every sector can improve their efficiency, cut costs, and innovate faster. From logistics and manufacturing to healthcare and finance, the potential productivity boost is enormous. This isn’t bad news—it’s a massive opportunity for non-tech companies to thrive.

Yet, the market seems fixated on the short-term impact to companies that *develop* AI or produce the hardware for it. It’s as if the market is missing the forest for the trees. Why should the total value of all publicly traded companies *fall* on the news of a breakthrough that’s bound to make them more productive and profitable?

This feels like a moment where the market hasn’t fully priced in the reality of what this could mean. In the long run, wouldn’t a global index fund naturally benefit as this technology drives economic growth across industries?

So here’s my question to the community:

* Is the market too focused on the immediate losers (like NVIDIA or TSMC) while ignoring the broader winners?
* How can investors position themselves to reflect the long-term productivity gains from this development?
* Are there sectors, regions, or funds that might capture this shift better than a traditional global index fund?","['NVDA', 'NVDA']",0,24,19,2025-01-27 21:53:19+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ibl8xf/the_market_is_dropping_after_huge_ai/,0.9922
investing,I believe Nvidia's sell-off is justified—I think they have lost their MOAT.,"A large part of Nvidia’s stock price is tied to the perception that their latest and greatest chips are the only way to achieve the best AI models. However, DeepSeek has proven that this is not the case—state-of-the-art models can be developed using older chips. Granted, they still used Nvidia chips, but this fundamentally shifts the equation.

This means Nvidia has lost its pricing power. If they price their latest chips too high, customers now have the option to simply use older chips or even switch to AMD’s alternatives.

Effectively, this erodes Nvidia’s competitive advantage and commoditizes their chips.

I agree that AI developers largely use CUDA, and Nvidia's ecosystem is still vast, but... DeepSeek’s model development costs are **27x cheaper** than the latest models developed by American companies. DeepSeek’s subscription costs **$0.50** compared to ChatGPT’s **$20** subscription. Granted, it’s a Chinese company, and there are valid security concerns, but they have published all their research openly—meaning any other company can leverage this research to build models at a lower cost.

Unless someone can definitively prove that Nvidia’s latest and greatest chips are absolutely necessary for developing the best AI models **and** that those best models will provide meaningful value to end customers, I don’t see how Nvidia can maintain its edge.","['NVDA', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'AMD', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'NVDA']",0,78,41,2025-01-27 21:39:06+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ibkwgf/i_believe_nvidias_selloff_is_justifiedi_think/,0.9912
investing,Markets are Overreacting to DeepSeek,"The markets are overreacting to the DeepSeek news. 

Nvidia and big tech stocks losing a trillion dollars in value is not realistic. 

I personally am buying more NVDA stock off the dip. 

So what is going on?

The reason for the drop:  Investors think DeepSeek threatens to disrupt the US big tech dominance by enabling smaller companies and cost-sensitive enterprises with an open source and low cost, high performance model. 

Here is why I think fears are overblown.

1. Companies like Nvidia, Microsoft, and other big tech firms have massive war chests to outspend competitors. Nvidia alone spent nearly $9 billion on R&D in 2024 and can quickly adapt to new threats by enhancing its offerings or lowering costs if necessary.

2. Nvidia’s dominance isn’t just about hardware—it’s deeply tied to its software ecosystem, particularly CUDA, which is the gold standard for AI and machine learning development. This ecosystem is entrenched in research labs, enterprises, and cloud platforms worldwide.

3. People have to understand the risk that comes with DeepSeek coming out of China. There will be major adoption barriers from key markets as folks worry about data security, sanctions, government overreach etc. 

4. US just announced $500b to AI infrastructure via Stargate. The government has substantial resourcing to subsidize or lower barriers for brands like Nvidia.

Critiques tend to fall into two camps…

1. Nvidias margins are going to be eroded 

To this I think we have to acknowledge that while lower margins and demand would impact the stock both of these are speculative. 

Increased efficiency typically increases demand. And Nvidias customers are pretty entrenched, it’s def not certain they will bleed customers. 

On top of that Nvidia’s profitability isn’t solely tied to selling GPUs. Its software stack (e.g., CUDA), enterprise services, and licensing deals contribute significantly. These high-margin revenue streams I would guess are going to remain solid even if hardware pricing pressures increase.

2. Open source has a number of relative advantages

I think open source is heavily favorited by startups and indie developers (Open source is strongly favored by Reddit specifically). But the enterprise buyer doesn’t typically lean this way.

Open-source solutions require significant internal expertise for implementation, maintenance, and troubleshooting. Large enterprises often prefer Nvidia’s support and commercial-grade stack because they get a dedicated team for ongoing updates, security patches, and scalability.","['NVDA', 'NVDA', 'MSFT', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'NVDA']",2297,842,405,2025-01-27 17:44:35+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ibf2mt/markets_are_overreacting_to_deepseek/,0.9481

investing,Third Coast Bancshares: Continued Growth In A Booming Region,"I have been covering numerous small & mid cap banks for quite some time now and I am bullish on the continued growth of many names. TCBX is based in the high-growth Texas metropolitan areas with very impressive growth despite the fact Texas has more banks than any other state. Here is my analysis on this particular community bank:

Hope to hear from everyone on their thoughts on this company / the future outlook on financials

# Macro Overview:

* **Economic Strength of Texas:** Third Coast operates in Texas, whom remain one of the fastest-growing states in the U.S. that recently [grew at 4.2% in Q3 2024](https://gov.texas.gov/business/page/texas-economic-snapshot#:~:text=(Texas%20Comptroller%20of%20Public%20Accounts,U.S.%20Bureau%20of%20Economic%20Analysis)), faster than the nation as a whole. Business friendly policies like no state income tax, have helped corporate relocation's like Tesla, Oracle, and Hewlett-Packard. Texas's economy is the [eighth-largest](https://gov.texas.gov/business/page/texas-economic-snapshot#:~:text=(Texas%20Comptroller%20of%20Public%20Accounts,U.S.%20Bureau%20of%20Economic%20Analysis)) when compared to nations of the world and is now valued at $2.6 trillion. Texas is expected to continue to grow and with that the need for lending capabilities should favor Third Coast.
* **Impact of Potential Deregulation:** [Deregulation is expected to play a pivotal role](https://www.thebanker.com/content/05e97cf7-7d6a-580d-91cb-d27cd4d03092) in the new administrations economic agenda. For community banks like Third Coast, this will allow them the ability to operate more freely with relaxed capital requirements. With fewer regulatory requirements, Third Coast can selectively increase their exposure to higher yielding loans and potential acquisitions. Typically, the ability to freely lend boosts bank earnings and growth. It allows the industry the flexibility to regulate themselves. With deregulation almost certain, focusing on further risk-taking is important. This approach may lead to increases in nonperforming loans down the line.

# Investment Thesis:

* **Presence In A High-Growth Region:** Texas has one of the strongest economies in the U.S. consistently outpacing the national GDP growth rate. Third Coast has shown a great track record of impressive growth with a CAGR of over 25% and EPS growth of over 18% from 2020 to 2024. Deregulation in the banking industry is all but certain in the coming months. This will lead to increased lending capabilities that will fuel additional growth in a region that continues to outperform. Third Coast's lending increased 9% to $3.97 billion. Urban centers like Austin, Dallas-Fort Worth, and Houston are hubs for technology, energy, and manufacturing. In particular, residential construction is anticipated to rebound in 2025 fueled by increased populations, jobs, and incomes.
* **Current Valuation:** Third Coast has a P/E (TTM) of 14.65, slightly below the [industry average of 14.8](https://simplywall.st/markets/us/financials/banks). Yet, the stock has risen over 93% in the last year alone and is just -2.5% from its 52-week high of $37.65. Despite the significant increase, Third Coast is still slightly undervalued. It is significantly under their five-year average high P/E of 16.9. With continued growth expected in the long-term, we believe it is best to either wait for a potential pullback, or continue holding.
* **Strong Financial Results:** Fierce competition in Texas is intense with hundreds of banks. Nevertheless, Third Coast has achieved impressive results since their 2021 IPO. Revenue has increased 80%, EPS 194%, and net income 317%. Profitability metrics like return on average assets, return on average equity, and net profit margin have set new records. They have hit highs of 1.05%, 11.48%, and 27.82%, respectively. Nonperforming assets did however increase by 48.7% to 0.58% of total assets. While increases are not desired, the total is still significantly under the industry average indicating proper risk management for now.

# Loan Growth & Quality

* **Nonperforming loans:** Often, solid loan growth comes with risky lending practices. Third Coast predominately lends to CRE and C&I, combined accounting for almost 60% of the total portfolio. Nonperforming loans increased by 61.4% to $27.95 million. A large reason for such a major increase stemmed from C&I accounting for over 51% of nonperforming loans. Non-farm non-residential owner occupied loans accounted for 39%. Fortunately, non-farm non-residential owner occupied loans decreased -14% despite their 11.3% weighting.
* **Nonperforming assets:** Unsurprisingly, nonperforming assets increased by 48.7% as a result. Currently, nonperforming assets are only at 0.58% which is still minor for a community bank. We do not want to see a continuation of nonperforming assets. They can easily start to wipe out a bank's equity. Third Coast has grown fantastically, as has nonperforming loans and assets. Both are now at all-time highs for the banks. We will be monitoring this development in the upcoming quarters to ensure this does not rapidly continue.

# Earnings Overview

* **Revenue:** Fiscal 2024 saw an increase of 16% to $171.38 million. Third Coast benefited from a 15.2% increase in net-interest income due to elevated interest rates. This allowed the bank to reprice loans at higher yields. Floating-rate loans especially boosted interest income, despite rising deposit costs. Total non-interest income also saw impressive growth of 29.4% to $10.62 million contributing to the overall increase in revenue.
* **Net Income:** An impressive increase of 42.7% lead to a total of $47.67 million. This increase was primarily the result of increased net interest income, resulting from loan growth.
* **EPS:** Earnings per share saw strength with growth of 40.4% to $2.78. Higher revenue, controlled cost management, and rising profitability were the primarily reasons for such an increase.","['TSLA', 'ORCL']",2,0,0,2025-01-27 15:28:40+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ibbqer/third_coast_bancshares_continued_growth_in_a/,0.9995
investing,Jevon's Paradox explains why DeepSeek's breakthrough should increase Nvidia and TSMC demand,">Jevons’ Paradox occurs when technological improvements or efficiency gains in resource use lead to an overall increase in resource consumption, rather than a decrease.

>**Initial Expectation**: Efficiency improvements (e.g., using less fuel per kilometer with more efficient cars) should reduce the consumption of the resource (fuel).

>**What Actually Happens**: Increased efficiency lowers the cost of using the resource, making it more accessible and attractive. This, in turn, can increase demand for the resource, potentially leading to greater overall consumption.

TSMC and Nvidia should be going up - not down - because of Deepseek. DeepSeek made OpenAI-level models cheap. Consumption will go drastically up. When consumption goes up, more Nvidia and TSMC chips will be purchased to power them.

Better models do not hurt Nvidia and TSMC. They help. TSMC and Nvidia don't care who is making the best models, as long as they make it on their hardware. I would sell TSMC/Nvidia if Deepseek trained their models on Chinese-made chips. But they trained them on 10k+ Nvidia GPUs made by TSMC.

Further more, it makes companies like OpenAI and Anthropic try even harder to build moat, which means going all in on data centers.

Finally, DeepSeek's own paper says to move to the next step, you need more compute power:

>Therefore, we can draw two conclusions: First, distilling more powerful models into smaller ones yields excellent results, whereas smaller models relying on the large-scale RL mentioned in this paper require enormous computational power and may not even achieve the performance of distillation. Second, while distillation strategies are both economical and effective, **advancing beyond the boundaries of intelligence may still require more powerful base models and larger-scale reinforcement learning.**","['NVDA', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'NVDA']",100,95,45,2025-01-27 15:04:45+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ibb4qa/jevons_paradox_explains_why_deepseeks/,0.9922

This is usually not a problem, but there are times where a stock or ETF I want to buy is cheap, but the current exchange rate is not favorable, e.g. the dollar or euro is expensive at the moment or vice-versa—I want to sell an asset but the dollar or euro is cheap.

Currently, the PLN is quite strong and I can buy the EUR and USD for fairly cheap compared to the past years. I'm wondering if it would make sense to exchange my PLN for these currencies and then buy and sell the assets directly with the currency, which would allow me to later sell my stocks without having to automatically reconvert back to PLN, meaning that I can wait for a favorable time to re-exchange them.

* **Strong Sell Rating:** Quantum Computing Inc. (QUBT) is rated a 'Strong Sell' due to excessive valuation and poor financial performance.
* **Speculative Bubble:** QUBT’s $1.3 billion market cap is speculative, with minimal revenue and high costs. The company struggles to compete with larger, well-funded competitors.
* **Lack of Product-Market Fit:** The company's products and goals appear unfocused, making the investment case weak.
* **Financial Weakness:** Recent funding of $190 million has given it runway but raised expectations for rapid execution and revenue growth.
* **Competitive Disadvantage:** QUBT is significantly outmatched by industry giants like Google, IBM, and Microsoft in resources and talent acquisition.
* **Incredible Shorts:** IonQ (IONQ) and Rigetti Computing (RGTI) also pose shorting opportunities due to overvaluation.

Quantum Computing Inc. (QUBT) has been caught up in the recent rally of quantum computing stocks fueled by advancements from giants like IBM and Google. However, QUBT’s fundamentals are weak, and we recommend investors sell their shares. The company’s $1.3 billion market cap is largely speculative, with just $101,000 in quarterly revenue and high operating expenses, resulting in significant losses.

Despite raising $190 million in recent equity offerings, the company’s ability to execute remains questionable. QUBT’s approach to product development, including the Dirac-3 platform and a thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) foundry, lacks clarity and focus. Revenue sources like a LiDAR project for Johns Hopkins University seem misaligned with the company’s stated goals, further complicating the investment case.

While the funding provides financial runway, it does not close the vast resource gap between QUBT and competitors like Microsoft, Google, and IBM, which collectively spend orders of magnitude more on R&D. Attracting top talent in this environment is a significant challenge for QUBT.

Valuation-wise, QUBT appears vastly overinflated. Its assets, including recent funding, are valued at approximately $185 million, leaving over $1 billion of speculative value. Even under the most optimistic assumptions, the stock has significant downside risk.

Although shorting QUBT may be too risky for some investors, we strongly advise selling existing shares. Similarly, IonQ (IONQ) and Rigetti Computing (RGTI) also appear overvalued and represent potential short opportunities.

**TLDR:** Quantum Computing Inc. (QUBT) is heavily overvalued with negligible revenue and disorganized goals, making it a risky investment. Despite recent funding, it’s unlikely to compete with industry giants. IonQ and Rigetti Computing are similarly overvalued and present strong short opportunities.","['MSFT', 'MSFT']",11,6,4,2025-01-23 01:51:31+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1i7sd6q/qubt_another_case_baseless_speculation_in_quantum/,0.9956

investing,Meta: this sub seems dead and I think both users and mods are at fault,"This will most likely get removed as well. But as a long time contributor on this sub I want to vent a little.

What’s the purpose of this sub? The mod team says we shouldn’t post financial news by itself since they are “low effort posts”, so they are encouraging personal opinions being shared.

But then you have people just asking simple questions, and most of the answers are “just buy index funds” regardless of what the questions are.

Any long-form opinions are either met with dismissive “you have no idea what you are talking about, just by $VOO” or no response at all. 

So we can’t post financial news by themselves, and this isn’t the sub for single stock discussions, and any generic investment discussion just leads to “buy index funds”.

Btw mods, I understand that you guys don’t want “low-effort posts”, but if a post received 300+ upvotes and 200 comments within 3 hours (and many of those comments had efforts put into them), maybe it’s ok to leave it up? It’s not like the front page is full anyway. It’s frustrating to see a thread heating up only for you guys to remove the entire thing. 

Edit: Honestly I’ll just say it: I think the mods are more at fault because their vision of a high quality, high engagement discussion forum with high barrier of entry is simply not achievable on a platform like Reddit without making the sub semi-private with individual vetting process, which takes a ton of work that I’m not sure the mods are willing to spend time on.

I’ve been a mod on a couple super large subs and i fully understand how difficult and thankless the job can be. But my philosophy is that moderators of large subs should be the caretakers instead of gatekeepers. 

There are better places than Reddit for small, closed off communities with high barrier of entry. Let Reddit be Reddit, for better or worse.",['META'],1231,315,170,2025-01-21 14:17:44+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1i6jjup/meta_this_sub_seems_dead_and_i_think_both_users/,0.4486

investing,What are your thoughts on AMD?,"Context: I am a sixteen year old self-investor with over 100k invested. I have been interested in financial markets for two years now and started investing at fourteen years old in my mother's TFSA - the Canadian equivalent of the USA's Roth IRA. I've been lucky to start investing at the perfect time to catch both years of 20%+ gains from the S&P500. I am very interested in learning about anything related with invested and markets. I plan to go to University and obtain a Bachelors of Finance. With that degree, I plan to become a financial analyst and hopefully later become a Portfolio Manager. I've learned a lot about thr investing world over the few years and I'm interested in AMD.

Analysis of AMD: In my opinion, AMD (Advanced Mirco Devices) is a BUY. When looking at its Income Statement and overall business performance and potential, I see the potential for massive growth in the next decade. It's down around 25% from last year but that's only a reason to keep buying the dip. Looking at it's PE ratio, it is relatively cheap when compared to NVDA. I know some people argue that NVDA is a much better company as it's profit margin and revenues are significantly higher than AMD, (As it will remain that way) but many people have the concept wrong. AMD does not have to beat NVDA to do well. AMD is crushing intel in the semiconductor sector as it continues to grow exponentially. I am also considering selling some of my equity positions to buy some less risky assets such as treasuries. The chance of the S&P500 doing more than 10% this year is slim and even if it does, the market is due for another correction in which I'll buy some stocks then.

investing,Palantir: Overhyped Valuation and Growing Risks in a Shifting Market,"Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR) is trading at valuation levels far exceeding industry norms, raising serious concerns for potential investors. Its price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 64.7x represents a staggering premium of 1,885% over the sector median of 3.2x, while its forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 203x highlights a 708% premium compared to the sector median of 25x. For historical context, Microsoft’s P/S ratio peaked at 31x during the dot-com bubble, less than half of Palantir’s current level. Enterprise value metrics further amplify these concerns, with Palantir showing an EV/Sales ratio of 64.8x versus the sector median of 4.1x, and an EV/EBIT ratio of 469.9x compared to 21.4x. Adding to the risks, Palantir's projected earnings growth is slowing, with EPS growth expected to decelerate from 51.7% in 2024 to 25.17% in 2025. In an environment of stagnant interest rates, these extreme valuations heighten the risk of a significant correction, making caution essential for investors.

Palantir’s reliance on government contracts, which accounted for 56% of its revenue—approximately $1.11 billion in the first nine months of 2024—is another critical risk. The Department of Defense represents 70%-80% of these contracts, highlighting Palantir's heavy dependence on a single government segment. This reliance is further compounded by termination-for-convenience clauses, allowing contracts to be canceled with notice periods as short as 3-6 months, and annual renewal requirements due to legal restrictions against multi-year agreements. Palantir also faces high customer concentration risk, with its top three customers contributing 17% of revenue in 2024, down only slightly from 19% in 2023. The Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.) initiative, aimed at reducing federal spending, poses additional risks to contract renewals and revenue stability.

The company’s stock skyrocketed by 144.27% over six months as investors treated Palantir as a high-growth stock. However, this speculative momentum has led to overvaluation and risks of multiple compression—where profits increase but share prices stagnate or decline. For example, Palantir and peers like CrowdStrike (CRWD) and The Trade Desk (TTD) have an average P/E ratio of 395.73%, underscoring significant overpricing. In 2025, a stagnant interest rate environment and reduced consumer spending, driven by inflation adjustments, are likely to further pressure profits and stock performance. The broader market's shift toward stable blue-chip stocks has already reduced speculative investments, as reflected in Bitcoin's trading volume decline from 4.17 million in 2020 to 387,000 in 2024. This changing investor attitude could exacerbate the decline in Palantir’s valuation.

Despite impressive AI-powered platforms like Gotham, Foundry, and Apollo—designed to enhance data integration and decision-making—Palantir faces stiff competition from established tech giants like Microsoft and IBM and specialized firms like Snowflake and Databricks. While the AI boom has driven revenue growth, with a 30% year-over-year increase in Q3 2024, sustainability is a concern as overreliance on AI hype can lead to inflated valuations disconnected from long-term fundamentals. Palantir’s total revenue grew to $726 million in Q3 2024, with U.S. commercial revenue increasing 54% to $179 million, reflecting progress in diversifying beyond government contracts. However, its dependence on AI-driven growth and federal spending still poses significant risks for long-term stability.

Historical precedents, such as the dot-com bubble, show that companies with extreme valuations, like Cisco and Oracle, faced dramatic corrections that required years or decades to recover. These lessons emphasize the importance of valuation discipline and fundamental analysis. While Palantir remains a prominent player in AI and analytics, its inflated valuation, slowing growth, and reliance on speculative market trends suggest caution for investors. Analysts currently rate Palantir as a “Moderate Sell,” highlighting the potential for significant losses despite its technological strengths and government connections.

**TL;DR:** Palantir’s extreme valuation, heavy reliance on government contracts, slowing growth, and overdependence on AI hype pose significant risks, particularly in a market increasingly favoring stable investments.

investing,TSMC: The Backbone of Global AI Chipmaking,"Summary:

* **Global Leadership in AI Chips:** TSMC dominates the semiconductor market, producing over 90% of the globe’s most advanced chips, crucial for AI and HPC applications.
* **Geopolitical Risks:** Taiwan’s political tensions with China and U.S. export restrictions could affect TSMC, but its Arizona expansion helps mitigate risks.
* **Strong Market Position:** Partnerships with Nvidia, Apple, and AMD highlight TSMC’s technological edge, particularly with 3nm and 5nm nodes.
* **Investment Potential:** Despite challenges, TSMC's 2025 focus on AI growth, HPC revenue, and strategic diversification underscores its value as a long-term investment.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) is the global leader in advanced chip manufacturing, powering the AI revolution with its cutting-edge technology. As the primary supplier for tech giants like Nvidia, Apple, and AMD, TSMC produces over 90% of the world’s most advanced semiconductors, which are essential across industries, from military systems to consumer electronics. The company’s dominance is driven by its consistent investment in leading-edge processes, including 3nm and 5nm nodes, which form the backbone of high-performance computing and AI applications.

However, TSMC faces significant geopolitical risks due to its concentration in Taiwan, a region under constant tension with China, which views Taiwan as a breakaway province. A disruption in TSMC’s operations could spark a global semiconductor crisis, impacting economies worldwide. To mitigate these risks, TSMC has been diversifying its production capabilities, with a notable $40 billion investment in its Arizona facility. This expansion strengthens supply chain resilience and ensures U.S. access to cutting-edge chips for AI, defense, and other critical technologies. Additionally, the U.S. CHIPs Act offsets the high operational costs of U.S.-based facilities and supports workforce development.

TSMC’s position as the backbone of the AI and HPC sectors is underscored by its strategic collaboration with Nvidia to produce advanced AI chips, such as the Blackwell series, further cementing its role as a critical supplier in this rapidly growing market. In Q3 2024, TSMC’s revenue grew by 36% year-over-year, driven by strong AI-related demand, and it projects that mid-50% of its total revenue will come from HPC applications in 2025.

Despite its strengths, TSMC must navigate industry challenges, including the cyclical nature of the semiconductor market, declining PC and smartphone demand, and Wall Street's caution over potential growth slowdowns. Innovations in AI-driven consumer technologies and CES product launches could help revitalize these segments, with TSMC’s advanced chipmaking capabilities playing a central role.

From a valuation perspective, TSMC’s forward P/E ratio of 22.81 and PEG ratio of 0.73 suggest that while the stock trades at a premium, it remains reasonable given the company’s earnings growth and leadership in the AI sector. Geopolitical risks, while significant, are partially mitigated by the company’s diversification and reduced reliance on China, which now accounts for only 10% of its revenue.

TSMC has outperformed the semiconductor market benchmark (SMH) due to its advanced technology and strategic partnerships, recovering more quickly from market selloffs and demonstrating strong resilience. The company’s ability to balance geopolitical risks, invest in cutting-edge technologies, and sustain high demand for its products positions it as an attractive long-term investment.

In conclusion, TSMC’s leadership in semiconductor innovation and its critical role in AI chipmaking make it indispensable to the global technology industry. While challenges remain, its proactive approach to diversification and its focus on high-growth sectors like AI and HPC ensure its continued success and solidify its appeal as an investment in 2025.

TLDR: TSMC is a global leader in semiconductor manufacturing, pivotal for AI chipmaking with unmatched technological dominance. While geopolitical risks and U.S.-China tensions pose challenges, the company’s strategic expansions, such as its Arizona facilities, and its robust growth in AI-driven markets make it a compelling investment in 2025.

investing,Criticize my stock picking portfolio,"This sub has some people who are smart, and probably more attuned to individual stock picking than I am. But I still like to invest in single stocks, although I am waiting to see if 5 years from now I should have invested in an index fund instead. I’d be thrilled to hear what’s bad in my portfolio. 

Francaise des Jeux, 33% of my portfolio. A French lottery monopoly. I bought the stock recently, because I think the business will do well in the future and the I liked the relative value compared to investing in top U.S companies. I felt that this business is more certain with the facts I could gather compared to investing in Apple for example. Apple is a great business too, but is valued higher in terms of earnings multiple or how much dividends I can get if I invested in it today. I like the fact that the company is growing and gives me certainty a bit. The French Government or the EU don’t have plans to regulate this business heavily in the near term. Meanwhile, the profitability is high.

Multitude, 22% of my portfolio. A small cap financial institution in Europe, that has 3 segments. One segment earns about 50 million euros in operating profit, while the two others drag the company’s earnings down. There I saw an opportunity, because the price at the lowest point when I bought was close to 50 million euros. Still makes me wonder whether the market has noticed something I haven’t. Maybe I am too optimistic that the value of this single unit is much higher than what is the current market value for the whole enterprise, about 100 million euros, and the market knows something I don’t.

Centrum Finansowe, 15% of my portfolio. A Polish financial operator, that provides debt collection services and financing to SMEs. The idea was that the price was cheap, and the financials looked solid. When I bought my first shares, the dividend yield was about 11%. If the business stayed solid, I would earn decent returns. There is a possibility of business improvement, meaning more earnings and dividends on my investment.

Indos, 12% of my portfolio. Similar idea to Centrum Finansowe. Solid financials and high dividend yield got me interested.

Japan Warranty Support, 13% of my portfolio. Initially I had looked up on this company’s competitor, Solvvy (known as Japan Living Warranty before), but the competitor decided to buy and merge an unrelated company to itself. Before, these two companies shared same characteristics: good profitability, operated in insurance and warranty business, and the stock prices did not seem egregious. Recently, JWS forecasted lower growth compared to its past performance, and the stock plummeted. I bought my shares at prices that are very close to today’s prices. Per one share, JWS has about 3000 yen in cash net of debt, meaning not including insurance liabilities but bonds and bank debt, and 4500 in net portfolio value. At a price of around 2300 to 2800 yen, I thought this could be a good buy. 

I invest globally, but have felt that stock prices move to opposite direction to what I expected. My picks have performed poorly, which leads me to think I am doing something wrong. Or there is randomness, I don’t know. It’s possible that investing in single stocks is not for me. Hopefully somebody smart would be so nice to criticize me. Thanks.

investing,CES Note On Nvidia (NVDA),"Jensen Huang, Nvidia CEO delivered the CES (Consumer Electronic Show) keynote on January 6th, 2025. An immensely popular event, with about 140,000 attendees, the charismatic Jensen drew a packed crowd. Jensen did not disappoint.

# There were three big announcements

# New Gaming Cards

Nvidia’s new line of RTX 50 Series gaming graphics cards is based on the company’s Blackwell chip architecture. Considering the massive leap Blackwell has made over Hopper, its previous iteration in data center applications, getting it to work in gaming is a huge deal – a massive improvement with superior rendering and higher frame rates for gamers.

# Digits

The Linux-based desktop computer with the GB 10 Grace Blackwell Superchip with a CPU and GPU. A first in its history at $3,000 “Placing an AI supercomputer on the desks of every data scientist, AI researcher, and student empowers them to engage and shape the age of AI,” Huang said.

It may seem like a niche product for high-end engineers/professors/scientists and researchers, but I think it’s a deliberate and excellent strategy to evangelize the product, through the folks who can develop use cases and apps that can further the market for cheaper at scale mass Digits in the future.

This is straight from the Nvidia playbook from the last two decades – they have always involved the scientific and research community from the start. I can bet a large number of these are going to be distributed free to campuses.

I think Digits will turn out to be a very consequential product for Nvidia – with several billion in revenue in a few years. But forecasts aside, what’s key is that Digits uses a scaled-down version of Nvidia’s Grace AI server CPU technology. It’s packaged in a Mac Mini-sized form factor with the help of Taiwan-based **MediaTek**, which Huang commended for its expertise in building low-power chips.

Quoting Tae Kim from Barron’s who authored an excellent book on Nvidia

>Over time, the logical move for Nvidia would be to scale down this CPU further for consumer Windows laptops. By integrating its graphics expertise, MediaTek’s power-saving capabilities, and the efficiency of Arm-based CPU technology, Nvidia could create a processor that offers leading graphics for gaming and high performance for productivity, along with long battery life. While prior Arm-based Windows PCs have struggled with software compatibility, Nvidia’s top-notch software engineering could make it work.

Huang strongly hinted that the introduction of Digits was a precursor to the PC market, even as there are questions about why Nvidia chose Linux over Windows – and we should hear more about that at their GTC conference in March.

It could shake up the moribund PC market, which has been suffering from a lack of growth rates after COVID-19. Desktop PCs and laptop computers still generate large revenues for **Intel** and **Advanced Micro Devices**, the primary makers of x86-based processors – a legacy that could give way to ARM-based processors, which Apple uses. Analysts expect Intel to generate $30 billion in revenue from its client computing business in 2024, according to FactSet, while AMD has $6.7 billion in revenue in its client segment.

Billions of potential new revenue are at stake for Nvidia, which is forecasted to make about $180Bn in sales in the 12 months ending January 2026. While data center takes up the largest share of revenue at about $150Bn of that pie and gaming, auto, and professional visualization (Omniverse) take the rest, a new source would help a great deal when data center revenue growth slows down.

In the past two years, Nvidia has monopolized the AI data center market with the best-designed, highest-performing chips. Nvidia would likely make a significant dent in the PC market as well as the new paradigm in edge computing with all the computing power and constant innovation and upgrades at its disposal.

# Cosmos

The third announcement was for COSMOS – a significant improvement over their Omniverse and the biggest catalyst/enabler of “Physical AI”, I’ll write a separate note on that.

investing,Covered call strategies for Nvidia holders with low cost-base,"I currently hold ~900 shares of Nvidia at a cost base of sub $5, and am considering selling covered calls as a way to earn the premium with minimal risk.

My overall outlook on the company is still bullish in the long-term, and I do plan to hold some of my shares, but with the market cap at nearly $3.3T I do not see the same trend of parabolic growth continuing.

Nvidia makes up roughly 30% of my portfolio. As, long as I choose a strike price I am comfortable selling at, I wouldn’t mind being assigned IF I was to hold until expiry, which I wouldn’t plan on doing as I’ve learned it’s better to exit once you’ve realized 50% profit, and re-roll to a new strike/date.

Now the part that I am looking for advice on is how you determine the entry strategy of strike/date for the most efficient premiums? Opinions seem to vary with general consensus being weeklies or monthly and targeting strikes with a delta between 0.1 - 0.15 to reduce the risk of being assigned. As well, avoiding selling CCs on red days, close to earnings, or big new drop.

What is your CC strategy for entry? Do you target a specific % daily increase in price before entering? Do you use 50/100/200 day averages as a guideline? 

Would love to hear all the different strategies folks have employed, and how it has been working for you.

investing,"If I'm hoping to retire BEFORE 63, should I be maxing my 401k contributions? ","30M for reference. 

I've been thinking about this for a few weeks now. I've been making max contributions to my company's 401k now for the last 3 years (since I joined) and across all 401ks that I have between my current and former employers, I'm sitting at 100k currently. Seeing the 100k for the first time felt really nice and it has made me realize how much closer I could be to retirement. 

Looking at a quick investment calculator, I'm on track to hit 1 million in my 401k in about 18 years assuming a modest 6% return rate with an average of 2k contributions per month (assuming no change to monthly contributions, so the true value here may be higher) which is my current personal goal. BUT 1million wouldn't immediately be enough for me to retire immediately (assuming I follow the 4% rule), and I'm hoping over time my periodic contributions will increase. 

But thinking about it, if I technically can't utilize this money properly until I'm in my early 60s (because it's been hammered in my head that we get penalized for pulling from a 401k before age ~63, with a few exceptions), is it worth it to keep contributing the max amount of money to a 401k vs a personal investment account? I have a personal investment account that is currently sitting at about 70k (VOO and some other personal tech stocks, like Microsoft, Nvidia) and I'm wondering if it would be a better move to just move more of my 401k contributions to my personal investment account instead? 

I'm not an expert in this area by any means, I've just been viewing all of these accounts as a form of savings accounts since I'm fortunate enough to be able to even set aside this money. And so this is the current situation that I'm in. I would love to be able to live a life not tied to a 9-5 and instead retire to work in an industry I enjoy at my own leisure(or get to a COAST amount minimum).

investing,Worth it to backdoor Roth at this age and situation?,"Hi! I (46F, wanting to retire early-ish) would like to do my first backdoor Roth conversion, but I would love confirmation from this group that it’s the right move for me. Currently, my Traditional IRAs have money in them, so I understand that I need to clear them out before doing a backdoor, so as not to trigger pro rata. I can roll them over to my current workplace 401(k), but my biggest misgiving is that my IRAs are with Fidelity (which I love), and my 401(k) is with Voya ADP TotalSource (which I don’t love).  Voya only gives a very limited choice of Funds, so I’m currently in Voyager Target Solution 2045 (since I’m 46 years old) and target date funds seem to always way underperform. The only other options I have for Voya funds are:



* Stable Value Fund

* BlackRock US Debt Index

* Fidelity Total Bond

* Vanguard Balanced Index

* American Funds Washington Mutual

* BlackRock Russell 3000 index

* American Century US Premier Lg Cap Growth

* Neuberger Berman Small Cap

* Hancock Dspl Val Mid Cap

* T.Rowe Mid Cap  Growth

* DFA Smal Cap Value Portfolio Inst Class

* BlackRock MSCI ACWI EX-US Index Fund

* American Funds EuroPacific



I’m very used to just buying funds like ITOT or FSKAX and leaving it. I’m not familiar with these offerings from Voya.



Is it still worth it to do a rollover to Voya so that I can start to backdoor Roth each year?



For reference:  



* My income is roughly $245k (this doesn’t include my husband’s finances, who manages his own stuff, but I would make sure to clear out his small Traditional IRA too since I believe we’re considered to be connected)

* One Traditional IRA has $83,122

* Husband’s traditional IRA has $3,250

* We both have Roths from when we had lower salaries (\~$175k), but I don’t think those balances matter for rollover purposes

investing,BeammWave (BEAMMW B): Unlocking the full potential of 5G,"**Summary:**  
Okay, so this post might be a little bit different from what you’re used to around here. But if you bear with me, I believe you’ll find it interesting. **BeammWave (BEAMMW B)** is a Swedish deep tech company led by the people behind the success of Bluetooth (yes, that Bluetooth), and they have developed the next generation technology for wireless communications. Their current market cap is about 150M SEK (5 SEK/share), but the potential market is in the billions of USD. Several of the biggest telecom companies in the world are currently evaluating their technology, aiming to implement it in future products (estimated 2025/2026). Such a revenue-generating implementation would be a major catalyst for the share price. However, operating in a very hot field, their substantive patent portfolio alone is likely worth significantly more than the current company valuation, drastically reducing the risk. 

 **My investment strategy:**

I consider myself a value investor, at least in the sense that I search for companies that are overlooked—and undervalued—by the market. Specifically, I spend a lot of time analyzing small, international companies, and I prefer to focus on those in the technology sector. Why? Because oftentimes, groundbreaking innovation comes not from the giant behemoths with thousands of employees and near limitless funding. Instead, it comes from small groups of talented people with great ideas and no bureaucracy to limit them. These small, early-stage companies often have quite unattractive finance sheets, so just looking at the bottom line won’t tell you much. Instead, I focus on three main points:

1. The people: An investment in a company is really an investment in the people running it. You can have the most promising technological solution and all the money in the world, but if the people in charge lack the skillsets, connections and passion to utilize it, it’s never going to take off. 
2. The product: Is there a need for it? Does it solve a problem? What is the market for it? What is the competition? You know the drill.
3. The valuation (and the financials): What has been priced in? Does the valuation make any sense? Also, I know I said the financials in these companies are often an eye-sore, but there are different levels of hell. Is there an imminent risk for bankruptcy or new share issues? How much do they spend a year? How long will it realistically be until they start making money?

It may sound obvious, but I really stick to these points. If one of them doesn’t hold up, I don’t invest. To quote Munger: 

*""And the wise ones bet heavily when the world offers them that opportunity. They bet big when they have the odds. And the rest of the time, they don't. It's just that simple.""* 

Meaning, I turn down the vast majority of the companies I analyze. But once in a while—when I find what I believe to be a truly undervalued company—I bet heavily on them. With BeammWave, this is one of those times, and I would love to hear your thoughts on it:

**BeammWave’s people:** 

The company is founded—and still run by—engineers. There is not one professional finance-bro-hustler within sight, only these old grandpas (literally) with more than a century of combined experience working at the biggest telecom companies in the world. For example:

· CEO: Stefan Svedberg, an electrical engineer who at Ericsson had a driving role in the development and global success of Bluetooth. Was also responsible for several M&As.

· VP of Business and Sales: Robert Cadman, who was in part responsible for bringing the Bluetooth technology to the markets. 

· Chief Systems Architect: Bengt Lindoff, one of the world’s most prolific inventors with 2000+ patents in his name, who most recently had a top position at Huawei (developing 5G systems).

· Chairman of the board: Fredrik Rosenqvist, a civil engineer and the ex-CEO of Saab Ventures, who amongst other things facilitated the sale of C3 to Apple.

I could go on, but you get the drill. Together, they not only carry an enormous respect within the industry—with far-reaching connections to the people at the very top of the big companies—but also an incredible know-how in just what it takes to successfully launch a new, revenue-generating technology. Also, they clearly have a lot of faith in—and passion for—BeammWave. If not, why would they all leave their cushy jobs at these giant companies to spend all their time and effort (and personal money) on this small start-up?

**BeammWave’s product:** 

Wait, why *did* they actually leave their top jobs and go work for a start-up? Well, it’s because BeammWave has achieved something no one else has done before: distributed digital beamforming (DDBF) at millimeter-wave frequencies.

So, what’s that? 

In short, it’s an objectively superior way to build the mmWave wireless communication systems of the future (meaning 5G, 6G and all the other Gs to come), providing much better data speed, capacity, signal strength and power consumption than what is currently used (i.e., analog beamforming). In addition, their DDBF solution also solves several of the critical problems facing the industry today, including frequency capacity saturation, the infamous mmWave Non-line-of-sight (NLos) sensitivity and more.

Companies like Verizon, Qualcomm and Apple has poured BILLIONS of dollars into mmWave technology, but so far it really doesn’t work very well. I won’t get into the details of the technology here, but if you find this post intriguing, I would highly recommend you to read up on it before investing. I believe it’s going to be difficult to really grasp the potential value of BeammWave (and how one small start-up could achieve what the market leaders couldn’t) if you don’t understand the technology at least at a basic level. Just know that literally everyone in the field agree that digital beamforming is far superior to the analog version used today. The problem has been that DBF has historically been more complex (ill-fitted for mass production), uses more power and costs more money. With BeammWave's solution, it is actually both cheaper, uses less power and is designed for mass volume production, while still delivering far higher data speeds etc. than the analog versions.

So why aren't other companies interest in their technology? Well, who said they weren't? BeammWave currently has 3 customers: Molex (a big electronics supplier for a lot of companies, including Apple), Alpha Networks (a Taiwanese electronics company) and an anonymous Asian market leader likely to be Murata (also an Apple supplier). These companies have already purchased BeammWave's development platform ADP1 and are currently building their own prototype products with it. Furthermore, BeammWave has a number of other partners, including Saab and Ericsson, while also having signed NDAs with other companies (think Samsung and Qualcomm) and are having ongoing discussions with a large number of companies (including ""the biggest companies you can imagine"", a CEO direct quote). As a testament to this, they have been given access to one of the biggest foundries in the world (in Germany) to produce their prototype chips (and assisting BeammWave with material/production). This is practically unheard of for a company of this size.

So, what does BeammWave actually do? Their actual product is an extremely advanced, 3x3mm radio-frequency integrated circuit (RFIC), coupled with software. It is optimized for high-volume production, with the goal to replace the currently used antennas/RFICs in not only smartphones, but in radar systems and satellites, drones, IoT devices, automotives, and FWA systems. They are likely to be earning 1-2 USD/chip, and a typical smartphone would carry 6-10 chips. Given that there are more than 1 billion smartphones produced annually (and that the handset market is just ONE of BeammWave’s markets), it actually becomes quite ridiculous when you start to crunch the numbers. We’re talking tens of billions of dollars if they manage to get even, let’s say, 15% of their TAM, and that is not considering how the mmWave market is expected to have a CAGR of 15-40% until 2030. Importantly, their technology is compatible with the current infrastructure, meaning that it's not necessary to replace current basestations etc. in order for it to work. 

What about the competition? Well, right now, there isn’t actually any competition. BeammWave is literally the first company in the world to succeed in doing this. This is of course likely to change, but considering the ""minefield of patents"" (a literal quote from the CEO) that they have put down around the concept of DDBF, and their intention to ""own the entire field"" (another literal quote), it will likely be very difficult for other players to develop similar solutions without having to pay licensing fees to BeammWave. Remember, it's not really a question *if* digital beamforming will replace the analog technology: it's a question of who will do it. And right now, however unlikely it may seem, BeammWave appears to be winning the race.

So far, the people and the product are all green in my book. What about the valuation (and the financials)? 

**BeammWave’s valuation (and financials):**

At the IPO in 2022, the valuation was around 200M SEK, which at the time was considered modest. Now, more than two years, 40 patent applications, a few giant customers and even more collaborations later, the valuation is...150M SEK (5 SEK/share) This is somewhat equal to what they have spent on the R&D, meaning that you get 10+ years of research from some of the best engineers in the field basically free of charge. Furthermore, they have practically zero debt. Analysts estimate the fair value *right now* (without any further deals) to be 7-12 SEK.

They just completed a warrants issue, and coupled with grants and sales of their ADP1 platform in Q4, they should have about 50M SEK in cash at hand right now, with the annual burn rate of 2023 being around 29M SEK. Thus, they should be liquid enough to get through at least 1 full year without any additional revenue. However, they have made clear that they expect several more customers short-term, and their stated plan is to have revenue-generation products hitting the market in 2025-2026. So far, they have never made any attempt at unwarranted hype-building, or promised things they couldn't keep, so I have no clear reason to doubt their words on this.

**So what's the catch?**  
I guess now would be a good time to ask what the problem is. The thing is, I don't know. There has so far been no failures, no broken promises, no deals that have fallen through or actually any signs of industry lack-of-interest. I genuinely don't understand the valuation, and would appreciate feedback on this, but I have two hypotheses:

1. BeammWave is listed on a small, Nordic market (Nasdaq First North) with very little influx of international investors.
2. The technology is incredibly complex and not very sexy. No one gets excited about radios, antennas, frequencies and complex telecom terminology. And, since the company is headed by engineers, they have had trouble presenting the company in a way that investors understand. Simply put, people don’t understand what the hell they are doing, and subsequently also fail to grasp the enormous potential of their technology. 

Furthermore, there are several obvious risks associated with investing in a company of this size (and in this industry). Here are the main Challenges & Risks as listed in their 2023 annual report:

1. **High-Competition Market:**
   * Operating in a field with resource-rich global competitors, where patent disputes are common.
   * Risk of design issues in their advanced semiconductor products, which could lead to costly rework or delayed launches.
2. **Operational Sustainability:**
   * Dependent on successful execution of product commercialization and effective utilization of raised capital.

Fair points. However, I think the management has done basically everything they can to reduce those risks as much as possible:

1. **Patent disputes:** They are talking with pretty much everyone in the field (and have been for years), having either signed deals/partnerships or NDAs with most. I believe this extensive networking and deep-reaching connections is a significant hedge against patent infringement, especially compared to start-ups run by less-experienced/connected people. 
2. **Product commercialization:**  The prospect of a successful commercialization is greatly helped by the early access to a world-class foundry, in addition to letting customers use ADP1 to build their own prototypes using BeammWave's technology. This way, it's up to the customers to make it work, with BeammWave adopting a supporting role. Also, considering the steady influx of new customers/partners/projects, I think it's quite unlikely that the technology doesn't work. There would be signs by now (cancelled deals/aborted projects etc.). It’s also important to add that For BeammWave, mass-volume-production was the number 1 criteria from the very beginning, and considering the experience they have (and the amount of testing they have done), I find it unlikely to discover any major flaws in the product. At least when compared to your average, run-of-the-mill tech start-up. 

With this said, I would love your feedback on this, and any criticism is highly appreciated. This post got really long, despite me trying to keep it relatively short. For example, I haven't event touched on the prospects of an acquisition, which I personally believe is probably the most likely case (by Apple, Qualcomm or some other giant player).

Cheers!

**Disclaimer:**  
I own about 32k shares of BeammWave and I intend to hold these for at least 2 years, or until acquisition. This is not a P&D (but I guess that is what at smart P&D:er would say), but a long-term holding with the potential to generate extreme profits. I’m not posting this analysis to pump the share price—any upcoming deal will be enough of a catalyst—but frankly because I’m frustrated that a company with this potential is practically unknown outside of the industry, and I thought you might find it interesting.

investing,BlackBerry: From Struggles to Stability with a Profitable Future,"**Summary:**

* BlackBerry has made significant progress in improving its operations and delivering positive free cash flow for the first time in 12 quarters.
* The divestment of Cylance is expected to streamline the business and enhance profitability.
* Competition in both the IoT and cybersecurity markets remains a critical challenge for the company.
* BlackBerry could achieve modest revenue growth in fiscal 2026, though uncertainties persist.

BlackBerry Limited (NYSE: BB) has long been a polarizing stock, with many skeptical about its ability to transform and thrive in competitive markets. After years of bearish sentiment, followed by a neutral outlook, the recent operational improvements and strategic decisions have prompted a reassessment of its prospects. The company’s ability to generate positive free cash flow and its strategic divestment of Cylance have positioned it for a leaner and potentially more profitable future, making BlackBerry an intriguing investment opportunity.

The company operates two primary business units: the Internet of Things (IoT) and Cybersecurity. Within IoT, BlackBerry’s key product, QNX, is an advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) operating system primarily serving the automotive sector. Meanwhile, its Cybersecurity division offers endpoint management solutions for government and enterprise clients. These two areas represent BlackBerry's focus for driving future growth, especially as the company seeks to recover from past challenges and deliver on its strategic objectives.

Recent results mark a turning point for BlackBerry, as the company delivered positive free cash flow for the first time in three years. This milestone is accompanied by the sale of its Cylance division, which was acquired for $1.4 billion but sold for $160 million, a nearly 90% loss. While this divestment underscores the missteps of prior management, it also represents a critical step toward simplifying the business and improving profitability. The sale allows BlackBerry to focus on its core operations, with fiscal 2026 offering the potential for more consistent growth.

The remaining business operations are expected to generate approximately $135 million in revenue for fiscal Q4 2025. Looking ahead, BlackBerry could achieve modest topline growth of around 2% to 4% in fiscal 2026, aided by favorable comparisons to previous periods. However, achieving sustained growth will require navigating intense competition in both IoT and cybersecurity markets.

BlackBerry’s valuation remains a topic of debate. The company finished fiscal Q3 2025 with $220 million in cash and marketable securities, offset by $195 million in debt. With $160 million expected from the Cylance sale, BlackBerry should maintain approximately $185 million in net cash, representing about 7% of its $2.5 billion market capitalization. This financial setup is encouraging but still leaves questions about BlackBerry’s ability to consistently generate strong free cash flow.

The company’s valuation of 4x sales reflects a cautious optimism about its future. While the sale of Cylance and operational improvements have reduced some risks, the path to sustained profitability and growth remains uncertain. BlackBerry must also contend with formidable competition. In the IoT sector, rivals like Samsara and major tech players like Amazon’s AWS present significant challenges. Similarly, the cybersecurity space is highly competitive, with companies like Palo Alto Networks and others vying for market share.

Despite these challenges, the company’s improving fundamentals and focus on core business areas suggest a brighter future. The new management team’s strategic decisions have positioned BlackBerry for growth, though execution will be critical. Investors should remain cautious but optimistic, as BlackBerry attempts to capitalize on its recent progress and deliver sustainable results in fiscal 2026 and beyond.

**TL;DR:**  
BlackBerry has shifted toward profitability, selling Cylance to streamline operations and focus on core business areas. While competition in IoT and cybersecurity remains a challenge, modest revenue growth in fiscal 2026 is possible. The company’s valuation and improving fundamentals warrant cautious optimism.",['AMZN'],12,10,6,2025-01-12 21:59:48+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1hzy7nm/blackberry_from_struggles_to_stability_with_a/,0.9987
investing,SoundHound: AI Hype Can’t Mask Weak Fundamentals,"**Summary:**

* SoundHound's stock price has surged due to the Amelia acquisition, but organic growth remains weak, and losses are substantial.
* The company operates in highly fragmented markets with growing competition, making substantial profits unlikely.
* The current extreme valuation seems unsustainable given poor fundamentals, though AI hype and growth via acquisitions may delay a correction.

SoundHound’s (NASDAQ: SOUN) stock has seen a dramatic pullback recently after an earlier surge driven by the acquisition of Amelia. While the acquisition has bolstered headline growth figures, SoundHound continues to face challenges in generating organic growth, and its financial losses remain significant. The company’s previous acquisitions have drawn attention to its underlying weaknesses, with critics pointing out that inorganic growth has been used to offset disappointing performance in core operations. Although the stock price has risen by over 200% since earlier criticism, the fundamentals offer little support for its current valuation.

Market enthusiasm for AI and speculative growth potential may continue to buoy the stock in the short term. However, achieving the level of growth required to justify the current valuation will be extremely challenging for SoundHound. The company's reliance on acquisitions suggests that organic scalability remains elusive, and its size makes future acquisitions less impactful.

SoundHound has made strides in developing its technology, particularly through Polaris, a multimodal foundation model trained on billions of conversations and millions of hours of audio. This model promises greater accuracy and lower hosting costs, which SoundHound has been gradually rolling out across its customer base. Polaris currently powers a third of SoundHound's AI interactions with restaurant customers, with plans to expand this coverage further. Additional advancements, such as reducing hallucinations and improving performance in noisy environments like vehicles, are also being pursued. However, given the company’s two-decade history, it is unclear if technological limitations have been the primary factor hindering its growth.

The automotive segment, one of SoundHound’s primary markets, has shown limited success despite the company’s long-standing presence. LLMs have enabled significant improvements in voice AI, but questions remain about whether voice interfaces will achieve widespread adoption or remain a niche feature. Vehicles represent one scenario where voice AI offers clear advantages, but even this market faces challenges. The anticipated rollout of advanced driver-assistance systems and autonomous driving features may reduce the need for voice AI in vehicles, limiting its potential market.

While SoundHound has reported some traction in the automotive industry, including deals with four EV OEMs and growth in markets like the Middle East, China, and India, its overall impact remains modest. Automotive revenue is estimated to be below $40 million annually, and the company continues to rely heavily on its relationship with Stellantis. Recent milestones, such as the integration of Chat AI into vehicles from brands like Alfa Romeo and Citroen, have yielded encouraging results, including increased usage and higher customer satisfaction scores. However, the scale of these achievements falls short of establishing SoundHound as a major player in the automotive sector.

The company’s pivot toward voice AI solutions for restaurants highlights its challenges in the automotive market. Acquisitions of Synq3 and Amelia have fueled growth in this segment, with SoundHound targeting a $1 billion revenue opportunity in drive-thru solutions. However, the reliance on acquisitions raises questions about the product’s market fit and competitive positioning. SoundHound has secured partnerships with a wide range of restaurant chains, including Panda Express, Church’s Texas Chicken, and White Castle. The company has also surpassed 100 million phone-ordering interactions, recently adding Torchy’s Tacos and a top-ten global pizza brand to its portfolio. While voice AI offers value in scenarios like drive-thru ordering, the broader adoption of touchscreens and mobile apps may limit its growth potential. Moreover, the restaurant AI market remains fragmented, with competitors like IBM, Google, and Microsoft pursuing similar opportunities.

Despite SoundHound’s claims of superior accuracy, metrics in this space are not standardized, making it difficult to assess the company’s relative performance. Various competitors have reported impressive results, such as Wendy’s FreshAI achieving an 86% success rate for fully automated orders during pilot tests. Smaller players like Hi Auto and Valyant AI have also gained traction, highlighting the competitive and fragmented nature of the market.

Financially, SoundHound’s revenue rose 89% year-over-year in the third quarter to $25 million, but this growth was primarily driven by acquisitions. Organic growth appears to have declined by roughly 50%, as prior-year figures included one-off revenue from a major automotive customer. The company has forecasted revenue of $82–85 million for 2024 and $155–175 million for 2025, suggesting minimal growth for its core business in the near future.

Profit margins have also been a challenge. Gross margins fell to 49% in the third quarter due to acquisition costs, though non-GAAP gross margins were reported at 60%. Longer-term, the company aims for gross margins of 70% or higher and EBITDA margins above 30%. However, these targets remain far from reach. SoundHound expects to achieve adjusted EBITDA profitability in 2025, though this metric excludes significant expenses such as stock-based compensation and depreciation.

SoundHound ended the third quarter with $136 million in cash and equivalents, along with $39 million in debt carrying a 15% annual cost. Management has hinted at the possibility of raising equity to reduce debt, but this would have a limited impact given the company’s current market capitalization.

Looking ahead, SoundHound’s revenue is projected to reach $275–325 million by 2029. At its current valuation, this implies a 30x forward revenue multiple—significantly higher than historical norms, even during speculative market conditions. By comparison, valuations during the peak of the SaaS boom typically ranged around 15x forward revenue. As a result, SoundHound’s stock price is likely to decline significantly unless the company can deliver extraordinary performance in the coming years.

SoundHound operates in a competitive, fragmented market and lacks clear competitive advantages. While its technology has shown promise, the broader market dynamics and the company’s poor financial fundamentals make its current valuation difficult to justify. Based on these factors, SoundHound’s stock is likely overvalued and could settle closer to $5 per share as market sentiment realigns with reality.

**TL;DR:** SoundHound has seen a surge in its stock price, driven by acquisitions and AI hype, but its fundamentals are weak, and organic growth is negative. With increasing competition in fragmented markets and a reliance on inorganic growth, the company’s current valuation appears unsustainable. A significant stock price correction seems likely.

investing,Questions from a 20-Year-Old Investor,"Hello everyone,

I’m a 20-year-old university student, and I’ve been dabbling in investments since I was 14. My approach so far has been quite basic, focusing on the following:

* Buying IPOs from family accounts and selling them 5 days later,
* Depositing funds into Binance dollar-backed coins up to the soft cap and earning interest,
* Mining Ethereum back in the day,
* Buying stocks during obvious dips and selling them a few weeks later,
* Allocating all remaining funds to Bitcoin.

My idea was to sell everything when Bitcoin reached $100,000—a threshold I set for myself—and then move on to other investment vehicles. However, I didn’t sell because I didn’t have a clear alternative investment in mind. Now, I’m determined to stick to this plan and explore new opportunities when Bitcoin hits $100,000 again.

# Questions on My Mind:

1. **AMD vs. Nvidia GPUs:** AMD GPUs often provide either better performance for the same price or similar performance for a lower price compared to Nvidia GPUs. Yet, Nvidia seems to dominate the consumer market. Why is that?
2. **Samsung vs. Apple:** A similar situation exists between Samsung and Apple. Despite Samsung offering competitive (or better) specifications for the price, Apple continues to dominate consumer preference.
3. **Stock Market Success:** In both cases above, Nvidia and Apple seem to outperform their competitors in the stock market, despite producing arguably lower-quality or lower-performance products. I understand the stock market doesn’t always reflect intrinsic value, but I’d appreciate book, documentary, or video recommendations to better understand the parameters that influence stock market success.
4. **Coca-Cola Stock Drop During Ronaldo's Incident:** When Ronaldo moved the Coke bottle during a press conference, Coca-Cola's stock value dropped. This seemed like an obvious short-term reaction, and therefore a perfect buying opportunity. Yet, many people sold low instead of buying for potential gains. Why do such clear opportunities often get overlooked?

investing,Clients' returns and the stock company's profits are at odds with each other,"I've worked as an asset manager, helping people manage their investments. My main focus is on designing retirement plans, especially for young clients. 

Here's the dilemma I face. I firmly believe in long-term investing in S&P500 or Nasdaq100 index funds, and that's what I advise my clients to do for their retirement planning from their early age.

The problem arises with short- and medium-term investments. 

The more frequently my clients buy and sell individual stocks, the higher the fees I earn, which makes me wealthier. Leverage stocks like 3x tesla have much higher fees than index funds as you know.  

But clients who trade frequently tend to see lower returns over time. On the other hand, those who simply buy index funds consistently or hold onto blue-chip stocks like google or micorsoft for the long term usually achieve much better returns.

Of course, these long-term investors don’t generate as much revenue for me. Yet, I often find myself advising clients not to trade too often, even though I know this reduces my own income. 

It feels ironic that the system is designed so that frequent trading benefits the stock companies or asset managers, but not the investors themselves.",['TSLA'],25,17,12,2025-01-12 08:34:34+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1hzif6o/clients_returns_and_the_stock_companys_profits/,0.961
investing,"Maybe I’m missing something, but the S&P 500’s annualized rate of return (adjust for inflation, dividends reinvested) is around 11% since 2009. 6% since 2002, and 8% since 1996. It seems we’re doing just fine in the long run?","Why all this worry about the next 10 years averaging 3% nominally? Even real returns?We’ve been on a bull-run, sure, but these calculations take into account the dips and our current high, which still show average returns over those years (when it should be the upper bound of what an investor can expect). So if we use that as our likelihood of high/low returns for the next decade, we can say that the likelihood of high/low returns aren’t that much higher than any other point in time. If anything, it doesn’t seem high, just slightly above average. For reference, what I consider good returns are like 5-6% real, not what the last couple years brought.

With all the news and articles I’m seeing, people think the US is doing too well as always when in reality we’re doing basically just as well even with the most profitable industry in history (tech).

*Correction: 11% real average returns since 2011 are quite high, yes, but that’s from the bottom of the dip to now. And if we zoom out, the bottom of the last 2 dips to now give us more modest returns. My point in picking the bottoms of every 10 year period was to showcase the upper bounds of returns.*

investing,Is it important for investors to differentiate between value and growth stocks?,"As a newer investor coming from the ETF side of things, a ""value"" approach has been my first way of learning to look at companies. I'm thinking more about their story, how they make money, whether they do it consistently, P/E ratio, EV/EBITDA, low debt, etc. 

I lurk around on r/ValueInvesting and have gotten some good book recommendations, although I mostly use them for reference rather than reading them in their entirety. 

The S&P 500 was at a P/E ratio of over 100 in 2008 when the market crashed, although there have been pullbacks and recessions with lower P/Es than at current levels. All that to say, maybe the market is overvalued by traditional valuation metrics. I guess I'm trying to understand why many users and even successful YouTubers like Joseph Carlson and others recommend many high P/E companies. I gather that these companies have a sustainable competitive advantage with a lot of growth priced in. I'm talking about companies like SPGI, ASML, GOOGL (this actually seems like a growth company with decent valuations), UBER, ARM, NVDA, AVGO, META, FTNT, AMD, etc.

These companies seem to have a good moat, great CEO's, strong balance sheets but a lot of growth priced in. Frankly, it seems like one could do quite well with companies like these. I've underperformed significantly (thankfully with small positions for the purposes of gaining experience) picking stocks with what I thought were traditional value metrics, companies like HDSN, JILL, ALB, CP, VIRC, etc. Granted, I don't really feel like I have a circle of competence and didn't look too much into how these companies make money. I'll admit that I was riding mostly on the convictions of others, which I recognize is a major issue in itself that I intend to correct going forward. 

So for those of you who invest in individual companies and have had success, here are some questions;

1) Is it productive to differentiate between growth and value companies?

2) Is it fruitful to look for companies with a 10-15 P/E ratio and other ""deep value"" metrics or is traditional value investing dead altogether due to modern age computing power?

3) Does the rise in popularity of index investing exacerbate irrationality in markets to the point where valuations don't matter?

Stocks,Tesla Will Be Bankrupt by 2032,"It starts when the cycle of Gamma squeezes stops—Tesla stock plunges 40% in a week after the company’s demand has continued to dry up, margins are further gutted, FSD proves to be the Theranos of self-driving software, and the long-promised Optimus Prime never arrives. 

Panic sets in as reality catches up with the fantasy. Overleveraged retail investors get wiped out, institutions quietly exit, and Adam Jonas scrambles to justify how he misread the signs. Within a year, Tesla is a shell of its former self. By 2032, it’s bankrupt. Here’s how we get there.

Tesla’s meteoric rise was driven by two things: a lack of real EV competition and government subsidies. Both are disappearing.

BYD has already overtaken Tesla in global EV sales and produces vehicles at a significantly lower cost. As Chinese manufacturers flood international markets with high-quality, low-cost EVs, Tesla will be squeezed on price and margin. 

EV buyers now have more options, and Tesla as a brand is becoming a liability. Meanwhile, the Cybertruck is a niche product that won’t move the needle.

Musk has promised self-driving robotaxis since 2016, yet Tesla’s FSD remains an unreliable hyped system that is not much more than an autonomous Level 2 system that requires constant human supervision. Competitors already operate driverless fleets. 

As Musk becomes more distracted by Twitter/X, politics, and SpaceX, institutional investors are losing confidence in his ability to focus on Tesla.

By the early 2030s, Tesla’s downward spiral is undeniable.

	•	Stock price erosion: As growth stalls and margins shrink, Tesla’s valuation will collapse from its inflated levels. Once it trades at auto-industry multiples, the illusion is shattered.

	•	Debt and cash flow crunch: Tesla has relied on stock dilution and regulatory credits to prop up its financials. As those revenue sources disappear, the company will struggle to maintain cash flow.

	•	Bankruptcy or acquisition: In a best-case scenario, Tesla gets acquired at a discount by a legacy automaker looking to salvage its EV infrastructure. In a worst-case scenario, it follows the fate of failed automakers before it—drowning in debt and unable to fund operations.

By 2035, Tesla is no longer a major player. The company that once symbolized the future of transportation becomes a cautionary tale of hype, hubris, and overpromising. The stock, once worshiped like Bitcoin, becomes just another bankrupt ticker symbol in the history books.","['TSLA', 'TSLA', 'TSLA', 'TSLA', 'TSLA', 'TSLA', 'TSLA', 'TSLA', 'TWTR', 'TSLA', 'TSLA', 'TSLA', 'TSLA', 'TSLA', 'TSLA']",0,42,32,2025-02-05 12:49:07+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ii96x6/tesla_will_be_bankrupt_by_2032/,-0.969
Stocks,Disney Tops Estimates With Gains From Streaming and ‘Moana 2’,"- Revenue increased 5% to $24.7 billion in first quarter

- Period was third straight quarter of streaming profitability

Walt Disney Co. reported fiscal first-quarter results that topped analysts’ estimates, fueled by the blockbuster film Moana 2 and higher income from its streaming services.

Excluding some items, earnings rose to $1.76 a share, Disney said Wednesday in a statement, beating the $1.42 average of analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Revenue in the period ended Dec. 28 came in slightly above expectations, increasing 5% to $24.7 billion.

The improved performances of Disney’s streaming operation and film studio led to a 31% gain in operating income for the quarter. Other Disney businesses struggled, with profit from TV networks slumping and theme park earnings little changed.

“Overall, this quarter proved to be a strong start to the fiscal year, and we remain confident in our strategy for continued growth,” Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger said in the statement. The shares jumped about 2.4% in premarket trading.

AI servers remain bottlenecked. Microsoft & Google can’t build AI data centers fast enough. That's why they couldn't beat expectations in cloud sales this quarter.

CapEx is being funneled into GPUs, networking, and AI-specific chips. This should make NVIDIA the biggest winner of this trend.

Also, OpenAI just introduced a new ""Deep Research"" AI model, designed for long-context reasoning. This will require even more compute power, further straining existing AI infrastructure. More power demand = more GPUs, networking gear, and data centers.

As long as AI models grow in complexity and scale, NVIDIA and AI infrastructure players should benefit. 

Even if Deepseek story was accurate, optimized model like Deepseek's will drive more demand, which will need even more powerful servers.

All the cases for yet another great year for chip makers especially NVIDIA, don't you think?","['MSFT', 'META', 'META', 'MSFT', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'NVDA']",23,8,7,2025-02-05 02:29:16+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ihzo1s/big_tech_capex_2024_vs_2025_and_increase_in_ai/,0.9485
Stocks,"AMD reports profit beat, but misses on data center revenue","Advanced Micro Devices reported fourth-quarter results on Tuesday that beat Wall Street expectations for sales and earnings, but the stock fell about 6% in extended trading as the company missed estimates in its key data center segment.

Here’s how the chipmaker did, versus LSEG consensus estimates for the quarter ended Dec. 28:

Earnings per share: $1.09, adjusted, versus $1.08 expected

Revenue: $7.66 billion versus $7.53 billion

AMD said it expects $7.1 billion in sales in the first quarter, plus or minus $300 million. It projected its gross margin to be about 54%. Analysts expected AMD to guide for revenue of $7 billion.

AMD reported $482 million in net income, or 29 cents per share, for the fourth quarter, down from $667 million, or 41 cents per share in the year-ago period.The company’s adjusted earnings per share excluded items such as acquisition costs, inventory loss at contract manufacturers, and restructuring charges.

Su told investors on an earnings call that AMD believes it will report “strong double-digit percentage revenue and EPS growth” in 2025.

The company’s most important unit is its business selling chips for data centers, which has been growing in recent quarters, thanks to demand for its graphics processing units for artificial intelligence.

AMD reported $3.86 billion in data center sales, which was up 69% on a year-over-year basis. The company said the increase was due to sales both in its Instinct GPUs and its EPYC CPUs, which compete with Intel’s processors.

However, analysts polled by FactSet were predicting $4.14 billion in data center sales during the quarter.

For the full year, AMD’s data center division revenue increased 94% to $12.6 billion. AMD said that $5 billion of those sales were from its Instinct GPUs for AI.

While AMD is far behind market leader Nvidia, it’s released competitive data center GPUs in recent years such as the MI300X, that some big infrastructure buyers, including Meta and Amazon, have embraced.

“We believe this places AMD on a steep long-term growth trajectory, led by the rapid scaling of our data center AI franchise from more than $5 billion of revenue in 2024 to tens of billions of dollars of annual revenue over the coming years,” Su said on the earnings call with analysts.

AMD categorizes its chips for PCs, laptops, and other individual computers as client revenue, which increased 58% on an annual basis to $2.3 billion. AMD said both its chips for desktops as well as mobile computers such as laptops are seeing strong demand.

AMD is also the second-largest producer of GPUs for gaming, behind Nvidia. Revenue in the segment declined 59% to $563 million. The company’s other small division, embedded chips, reported $923 million in sales, down 13% year-over-year.

Stocks,Apple launches app for party invitations in recurring revenue push,"Apple on Tuesday released a new app for creating invitations and sending them to contacts. The app is called Apple Invites.

Users can create events, such as birthdays, graduations and housewarming parties, and manage RSVPs and guest lists through the app. Apple Invites is also available on the web.

While users won’t need an iPhone to RSVP to events, they will need a paid iCloud+ subscription to send invites.

The launch is the latest example of Apple’s services strategy, whe company introduces new paid subscriptions that are marketed to its installed base of 2.35 billion active devices. Apple’s Services division has become the company’s second largest business behind the iPhone, reporting $25 billion in sales in the December quarter.

Services has also become a big source of Apple’s profit, with a gross margin of 74%. The growth of Apple’s services division is helping Apple’s overall margins expand in recent quarters after years of staying flat. Apple’s services business also includes its search deal with Google, Apple Pay payments and device warranties.

With Invites, Apple is taking on Partiful, a startup founded in 2020 that allows users to make and send event invites. Partiful did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

An iCloud+ subscription starts at $1 per month for 50GB of storage, and it’s included in Apple’s other subscription bundles, ranging up to a $38-per-month subscription that also includes the company’s TV service, Apple Music and access to games, fitness classes and news.

Invites also includes Apple Intelligence, the company’s suite of artificial intelligence software. Apple Intelligence can generate images for invites and help write the invitation with the company’s Writing Tools. Apple Intelligence also has the ability to share a photo album or playlist with an event’s guest list.

While Apple doesn’t charge individually for many of its iCloud+ services, it now has a host of paid features intended to get users to upgrade from free storage. That subscription service offers a VPN-style relay service for private browsing, custom email domains for iCloud, local security camera storage and the ability to generate burner emails.

Apple doesn’t disclose how many iCloud+ subscribers it has. The company last week said that it has 1 billion subscribers, but that figure includes subscriptions to apps through the App Store in addition to its direct iCloud subscriptions.

The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.

Yesterday was eventful, to say the least. Tariffs on Mexico/Canada are delayed, but we still have tariffs on China, and tariffs have been promised by Trump on the EU.

News: [As Trump Tariffs Take Effect, China Retaliates With Trade Measures Against U.S.](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/02/04/us/trump-tariffs-news?unlocked_article_code=1.uU4.ps2-.DRzgfM1GnN9i)

**Ticker:** [**PLTR (Palantir Technologies Inc)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=PLTR&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Reported earnings of $0.14 vs. $0.11 expected. Revenue of $828 million vs. $777 million expected. Management highlighted the power of AI and their sizable contracts, citing the nature of the AI war being winner-take-all.

**Technicals:** PLTR absolutely exploded and hit $102 premarket, currently watching $100 level to see if we continue the move. Other than that unlikely to be trading this unless we have massive volume come in.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The PLTR ER highlighted the growing demand for AI-driven solutions across government/commercial sectors. Company emphasized securing substantial contracts in the competitive AI landscape, important because they are more closely aligned with the current government.

**Risks:** Obviously being more closely tied to the government means that it has more leeway to be more monopolistic/aggresive in their actions, Alex Karp and Peter Thiel are closely aligned with current government leaders.

**Ticker:** [**NVDA (NVIDIA Corporation)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Chinese AI company DeepSeek is reportedly preparing to switch to domestic GPUs to circumvent NVDA chip restrictions. DeepSeek has bypassed NVDA CUDA for certain operations, utilizing the PTX (Parallel Thread Execution) language instead. Additionally, on February 2nd, DeepSeek, in collaboration with SiliconFlow and Huawei Cloud, launched DeepSeek-R1/V3 inference services on Huawei's Ascend AI chips. Huawei is also promoting its new Ascend AI processors to Chinese groups considering ""inference"" as an option.

**Technicals:** After the insane move we've seen from $150 to $118, I actually don't consider this to be earth shattering news- China has always been trying to develop their own semis and not using NVDA for training is what they were ""supposed"" to be doing due to the trade restrictions. I'm still long but selling calls against my position, recovery might be slow for NVDA. It's interesting that they are attempting to bypass CUDA, which is essentially the ""standard"" for ML/AI training nowadays on NVDA chips and developing their own.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** DeepSeek's move to adopt domestic GPUs and bypass CUDA indicates they're aiming for technological self-reliance amidst U.S. export restrictions, rather than trying to adopt more NVDA chips (which presumably isn't a viable long term strategy).

**Risks:** Nvidia faces potential revenue loss if Chinese companies increasingly adopt domestic GPUs and alternative programming frameworks. The effectiveness of U.S. export controls may be undermined as Chinese firms develop workarounds.

**Related Tickers:** AMD, INTC, QCOM, TSM

**Ticker:** [**BABA**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BABA&p=d)**/(oil stocks, car stocks, etc).**

**Catalyst:** U.S. implemented a 10% tariff on all Chinese imports, aiming to address issues related to drug trafficking, particularly fentanyl. In response, China announced retaliatory tariffs effective February 10, including a 15% tariff on U.S. coal and liquefied natural gas, and a 10% tariff on crude oil, agricultural machinery, and large-engine vehicles.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The imposition of these tariffs marks a significant escalation in U.S.-China trade tension and more volatility to come through Trump tweets- we might see a trade war again (sigh) like we did in 2019. Not 100% sure if agricultural machinery will affect stocks like DE but will look into it.

**Related Tickers:** JD, BIDU, TCEHY, PDD

**Offhand Comments:** There are going to be retaliation investigations against companies operating in America, INTC and GOOG have recently been announced as under investigation by China. But it's very important to remember which companies have a presence in China and which don't- for example, GOOG search hasn't worked in China since 2010 lol.

**Ticker:** [**GRAB (Grab Holdings Limited)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GRAB&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Grab Holdings Ltd. is considering a takeover of its Indonesian rival, GoTo Group, at a valuation of approximately $7 billion.

**Technicals:** Watching $5 level, no bias. I'm not 100% sure if there's an actual ""acquisition"" share price for GoTo but will keep eyes peeled for that acquisition premium.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The potential merger represents a significant consolidation in SEA's ride-hailing and food delivery sectors. Mergers typically streamline operations and reduce competition, leading to improved profitability for the combined entity.

**Risks:** The proposed merger may face regulatory hurdles, including antitrust concerns, which could delay or derail the deal. Standard M&A obstacles.

Stocks,Tesla’s Valuation: Speculation or Real Growth? My DCF Insights,"I did a quick and dirty DCF valuation for TSLA, and here’s what I found. I don’t own TSLA individually; I only have exposure through the S&P. However, with recent events, I’ve been wondering why people hold TSLA.

My typical process when looking into a company starts with a DCF to gauge approximately what the company should currently be valued at. I know, I know, it’s not perfect, but it’s a way to get started.

For TSLA, I averaged the last three years of free cash flow (FCF) at about $5.1 billion. I used a 5% FCF growth rate and a terminal growth rate of 3%, along with a discount rate of 12%. All these estimates are generous for a few reasons: the share count is increasing, FCF has declined over the past three years, and the risk is high.

With these assumptions, I came up with a value of $26.24, which is only 6.85% of the current price. This means that 93% of the value is based on future growth and speculation.

Now, many people assume that Tesla will revolutionize humanoid robots and self-driving cars, so I took a more optimistic approach to the DCF. I used a 20% FCF growth rate and a terminal growth of 7%, which is probably unrealistic. Using the same discount rate, I arrived at a value of $52.62. This represents 13.74% of the current value, meaning 86.26% is based on even more future growth and potential.

With all that said, it’s hard for me to understand what people see in this company. Or am I just thinking the wrong way, and it has nothing to do with making money?

Congrats to all the long-term holders who have made a killing! I’d love to hear your thoughts on this.","['TSLA', 'TSLA']",11,82,34,2025-02-04 03:09:52+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ih835v/teslas_valuation_speculation_or_real_growth_my/,0.993
Stocks,"EL5 to me, how will insiders benefit from all this volatility(Tariff on, no wait, its delayed, etc)","I saw this between 2016-2019, Apple used to go down big time whenever there was a China tariff announcement and then it used to come back up after a month since tariffs were cancelled or lowered.

For insiders to benefit from this up and down since they know in advance what the real policy would be, someone has to lose, right?

Are the losers who sell stocks after tariff announcements and maybe the insiders buy stocks on the dip and sell after recovers, rinse and repeat?

So, if we all just hold stocks as per our risk appetite and time horizon, and do not get shaken by this on and off abrupt policy announcements which get rescinded, we will be fine right.

IMO, this is not the time to hold leveraged positions(option credit spreads or stocks on margin or selling puts on margin) because you may get liquidated and your account will go to zero.

Trudeau elected to go ahead with retaliatory tariffs even though Trump’s order includes a mechanism to escalate the rates if Canada retaliates against the U.S.

Stocks,Do you think it's time to sell NVDA?,"The introduction of Deepseek probably doesn't warrant the sharp stock decline value of NVDA, that is understandable. But so is their stock value rise for the past 2 years. To put it in other words, yes the decline was a result of a hype, but so was the rise. Something that didn't make much sense got replaced by another thing that doesn't make much sense. At the end of the day, Nvidia is a great company that sells the best computer chips and GPU's, but that's all there is to it. I just don't see how they can rise again for the foreseeable future. They've hit a peak point in my opinion. And while Deepseek's introduction shouldn't have been the reason for their stock decline vlue, it was just a trigger for something that was in my opinion inevitable. 

I was pressured by family members into buying NVDA, and now the total loss is about 13.5% of its original price. I feel like I should just close the position as I just don't see how it can rise again for me to recoup the losses, but I also don't want to do something based on feelings.

I try to do some due diligence and understand metrics, but I'm no expert and I'm finding it difficult to put the time into learning these things with my very demanding fulltime job, which is why I usually stick with  low risky ETF's, except for Nvidia which I was kinda pressured into buying, and I was worried that it might become even more profitable and then hearing ""I told you so!"".","['NVDA', 'NVDA']",0,57,38,2025-02-01 09:33:36+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1if2ukg/do_you_think_its_time_to_sell_nvda/,0.932

Stocks,The case for Intel from a former Bear-Updated with Tariff News,"Six months ago, I posted this DD:
https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1e1w8a8/the_case_for_intel_from_a_former_bear/?ref=share&ref_source=link

I thought I might offer an update on developments since then—where I was wrong, where I was right, and how the stock might develop in my more humble opinion. TLDR: Tariffs—skip to the end.

I posted the original DD before the August 35% drop. I have continued buying, lowering my average price to $29 a share.

Where I Was Wrong

Clearly, the new products did not inflect Intel's earnings higher in Q4, and the Q1 guide was disappointing. Arrow Lake has been a dud in the desktop space. Lunar Lake, while being a very good part, just doesn't carry the margins I had hoped. Granite Rapids, while closing the gap significantly with AMD compared to prior products, is less competitive than I had hoped compared to AMD's new-gen Turin.

The shift from CPU to GPU has been more brutal than I anticipated (clearly, AMD's stock price is also reflecting this reality). Intel has also pushed Clearwater Forest back by about a quarter (from late 2025 to more likely late Q1/early Q2 2026) due to packaging yield issues.
Pat was also fired—but not for the reasons I would have expected. Falcon Shores AI GPU was canceled, but I had zero expectations for that anyway.

What's Going Right and What Might Inflect the Stock

Since the drop, Intel now trades at tangible book value—that’s essentially all cash and hard assets (excluding IP, brand, etc.), minus debts. So if the company shut down today, shareholders should get roughly $20 per share in cash after everything is sold. That puts a floor on the downside and makes it a likely takeover target if it falls further.

Intel’s 18A remains on track, which is the linchpin of any long-term investment in the company. We now have more clarity that it fits squarely between TSMC's 3nm and 2nm nodes. Yields are good, and they are installing tools in their Arizona fab. You don’t buy and install billions in equipment if the node is failing.
Panther Lake, their laptop CPU, remains on track to launch in Q4 of this year and will carry 60% gross margins (compared to 40% for Lunar Lake) while being manufactured in-house in the USA.

Intel Foundry is beginning to climb out of the hole this year, as I predicted in my original post. Just to put things into perspective, Intel’s 7nm node was designed so poorly for cost that its cost structure is similar to TSMC’s 3nm node and even to the upcoming 18A node. As 7nm wafers ramp down and EUV nodes like 18A ramp up, losses will shrink. For example, 18A carries a 3x selling price compared to Intel 7. Overall, outsourcing to TSMC will peak this year at 30% of wafers.

This process will be slow, so I would not expect any single quarter to make you go wow! Instead, I expect lumpy but improving quarters throughout the year. I originally anticipated a one-two punch, but it's more likely to be a grind until late 2026, when Intel will have strong products (Diamond Rapids, Clearwater Forest, and Nova Lake).

The Black Swan Event—Tariffs

However, there is a potential black swan event for current bagholders and potential investors.
I would not buy the stock based on the possibility of tariffs, but it's a large opportunity should it happen.
Trump, on 1/28 and today (1/31), reiterated that he plans to impose tariffs on chips and specifically singled out Taiwan, saying, ""You know, Taiwan, they stole our chip business,"" and claiming that 98% of chips are made in Taiwan. We are here to make money—not be political.

I often see many TSMC investors not fully understanding what they own. TSMC’s Arizona fab is planned to produce 20k 4nm wafers per month. Right now, TSMC is producing 125,000 3nm wafers per month in Taiwan and 150,000 5nm wafers per month in Taiwan. Their 3nm fab in Arizona won’t be ready until 2028.
So, U.S. production will account for only ~7% of TSMC’s leading-edge capacity—and by the end of next year, they will already be producing 2nm in Taiwan, further reducing that percentage.

Ultimately, fabs take years to build, so this dynamic won’t change for at least four years.
If tariffs happen, Intel will begin to report a surge in customer interest and prepayments as companies rush to secure dramatically cheaper wafers. Intel would not have enough capacity to serve the entire industry, so someone will be left bag-holding a product that’s 25-50% more expensive.
This would dramatically change sentiment, though revenue from these deals would start kicking in around 2026-2028.

There is also a dynamic between AMD and Intel with TSMC tariffs, but that’s still too speculative to dive into at this point.

There are a lot of technical nuances to this situation—like 18A not being amazing for mobile (18AP will help close the gap next year), and how quickly companies can port IP. But ultimately, necessity is the mother of invention, and cost differences will drive change.","['INTC', 'INTC', 'AMD', 'AMD', 'AMD', 'INTC', 'INTC', 'INTC', 'INTC', 'INTC', 'INTC', 'INTC', 'INTC', 'INTC', 'AMD', 'INTC']",58,21,16,2025-02-01 03:50:20+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1iexra7/the_case_for_intel_from_a_former_bearupdated_with/,0.9936

Stocks,"Speculation - walled garden platforms are the future, where to invest if so?","Given the dramatic rise of generative AI, I'm expecting the open web to become less and less useful, and not a place where people spend time.

Instead, I'm predicting a solid uptick in ""walled gardens. Platforms that create space for communities to exist and are - either passively through logins or aggressively through moderation and other tools - limiting access to generative content, providing opportunities for genuine connection, valuing high-quality contributors etc.

Now I'd be interested to hear what people think about this thesis, and if you buy into it then how and where you'd invest to profit from the momentum.

Meta is one example of a walled garden, but from their corporate strategy and my personal experience, they're going in the opposite direction and their apps are more and more full of generative AI content.

You could Throw in Cisco which has a monopoly over and controls about 66% of the cell phone networking hardware industry in American and it will still be roughly the same. By the way many of the companies on this long list have profit margins and growths that over the last year blow Tesla out of the water. Tesla is not outpacing other companies, other companies are actually catching up to them in the ways they have been growing.

Also, keep in mind that Musk just pissed off about 50 million democrats who were Tesla's existing core customer base. Multiple people at my work who own Tesla's have said they are now embarrassed to own a Tesla.

The speculation is partly based on Tesla's currently nonexistent and delayed automated taxi company. Let's put how weak Tesla's position in perspective.

Tesla plans to open an automated taxi company in Austin Texas this summer. 1 city.  Waymo (owned by Google) started in it's first city 8 years ago and is planning on expanding from 3 cities (San Fransisco, LA, and Pheonix) to 12 over the next year. Tesla is almost a decade behind in this industry and are not in a good position to dominate it or reach fully non city dependent fully automated driving in any way. There is also absolutely no indication that their business model is in a better position than their competitors in this industry currently.

For this current Market cap to be realized, Tesla would essentially need to come to control the majority of 3 major industries while Musk is sitting around playing video games for 12 hours a day (according to him) and playing politician in the Trump administration.","['TSLA', 'UBER', 'TSLA', 'TM', 'HMC', 'UBER', 'TSLA', 'TSLA', 'TSLA', 'TSLA', 'TSLA', 'TSLA', 'TSLA', 'TSLA', 'TSLA', 'TSLA', 'TSLA']",856,293,159,2025-01-31 19:11:51+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1iemmrp/psa_teslas_market_cap_is_now_higher_than_the_top/,-0.7274
Stocks,Tesla: The Company is One Giant Lie,"
Tesla just posted abysmal earnings, and how does Elon respond? With another song and dance about robots and self-driving cars—fairy tales he’s been spinning for years with no real results. Meanwhile, the fundamentals are crumbling: declining margins, demand issues, and brutal price cuts just to move inventory.

This company has been built on hype, not substance. FSD is nowhere near what was promised, Cybertruck is a disaster, and now they’re leaning on AI pipe dreams to distract from the financial mess. 

When a catalyst hits this, downward price action will be the most drastic in history. ","['TSLA', 'TSLA']",14992,1647,401,2025-01-31 17:10:23+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1iejost/tesla_the_company_is_one_giant_lie/,-0.9118
Stocks,"AAPL - 26,527.62% return over 25 years","Today to the day is the anniversary of twenty five years of my first purchase of AAPL shares.  I bought 1200 dollars worth.

In early 2000, I had just graduated college.  I had a few thousand given to me as an inheritance that was being managed by a broker.

 I asked the broker about purchasing some Apple shares, and he was unimpressed, and unmoved. I was annoyed at him. Apple was the one I had the strongest impulse to purchase.

 Why apple? I had gone from being skeptical of Apple. My  college was very heavily Mac, but I had PCs.  I was unimpressed at the OS, but I was struck by people’s reactions to Jobs.  He was enthusiastic, and I liked the cut of the jib who liked the cut of his jib. I was drawn to the elitism of the people to the brand, and felt it could bounce back. This was even before iPods, mind you, before OS X.  

These were the days of the dotcom boom. This broker was taking like 500 bucks for every trade. This felt unfair, in light of the great digital democratization that was in progress, I wanted the power.  And E*trade was relatively new and it seemed legit.  I hadn’t done anything like this before, I was just a kid, really, but I decided to just go for it. 

I sold most of the shares I inherited, and threw 1200 bucks into Apple.  `(also a few other, less impressive stocks)' I did marvelously the first few months as the market soared, as did most people. 

And…. it  came tumbling down in April 2000.  Disillusioned, I decided not to try to reposition my shares, and I just let things ride for a few months.  When I rebalanced by portfolio, I kept my apple shares, which had split, despite the pull-back.

Every year, I would consider would I buy more apple now?  And it didn't occurr me to sell. Apple often seemed almost comically undervalued, and I held on or increased my investment in it.

Every time apple goes up 1 point, I get more than my initial investment back. Why? Splits.

•	2-for-1 split in 2000  
•	2-for-1 split in 2005  
•	7-for-1 split in 2014  
•	4-for-1 split in 2020

Nowadays cost basis: .88 cents.     As of today that investment has grown 26,527.62%. I added more and more apple across the years, and had some other lucky calls (my second largest holding is NVDA) but no move matches that whimsical lucky move of 25 years ago today.

The security that owning these securities has offered me is significant.  It has let me have a job that isn’t that well-payed and support my family with emergencies being take of by extra funds. We own a lot of apple products, because with the dividends, it sort of just pays for them.

I do think it’s good to give early adults access to a few thousand dollars to play the market and plan to do that with my own children.  Although I didn’t sell my shares, what I did do is convert a bunch of them to a donor advised fund (avoiding taxes, whee), and I give to charity from that for annual giving, and that feels like a win win win proposition.  

I do feel overexposed in AAPL and NVDA, but due to still hopefully having another at least 25 years to go in my life is that pullbacks eventually come back up. The biggest principle that has guided my investing is “Don’t buy crap if you can help it”, and that's my advice to new investors.","['AAPL', 'AAPL', 'AAPL', 'AAPL', 'AAPL', 'AAPL', 'AAPL', 'AAPL', 'AAPL', 'AAPL', 'AAPL']",982,139,78,2025-01-31 16:46:00+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1iej3mb/aapl_2652762_return_over_25_years/,0.9979

I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments.

The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.

Catalyst I'm looking out for today- NVDA CEO to meet with White House officials, and server capex cost for DeepSeek estimated to be almost $1.3B. Deepseek capabilities are expected to be copied by US firms.

News: [Fed's Favored Inflation Gauge Posted Muted Advance In December](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-31/fed-s-favored-inflation-gauge-posted-muted-advance-in-december)

Ticker: [AAPL (Apple Inc.)](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AAPL&p=d)

Catalyst: Apple reported EPS of $2.40 vs. $2.35, and revenue of $124.3B vs 124B.

Despite these positive results, the company provided cautious guidance for the upcoming quarter, citing uncertainties related to the impact of new AI features on sales. Tim Cook mentioned that Apple Intelligence DID lead to stronger sales/growth in areas where it was rolled out (it has limited rollout right now).

Volume/Market Cap/Technicals: Watching $250 level, no strong bias. We've seen AAPL swing close to 20% this month, (on report of sales weakness in China) but doubt this will continue.

Context: Most immediate news that comes to mind was the weakness of sales in China for the iPhone, causing the move this month.

Risks: Don't really see immediate risks beyond the trade war, in 2019/2020 this resulted in AAPL moving manufacturing/production to other countries in South East Asia- slowing growth in China has been pretty consistent, however.

Related Tickers: rest of FAANG, Samsung if you can trade overseas stocks, the various phone component manufacturers that trade with AAPL

Offhand: Apple is investing in its own high-speed network infrastructure to enhance content delivery, (just like META's undersea pipeline)

Ticker: [ACMR (ACM Research, Inc.)](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ACMR&p=d)

Catalyst: Kerrisdale Capital released a bullish report on ACM Research (ACMR), a semiconductor wafer fabrication equipment (WFE) company positioned in China but headquartered in America.

It leads China as a leading supplier of wafer cleaning tools and beneficiary of China's push toward semiconductor self-sufficiency.

Kerrisdale predicts the company to eventually compete globally and cites it as a potential 10x return. Trades at 1x 2025E revenue (likely due to China fears).

Volume/Market Cap/Technicals: This is the interesting part- ACMR holds a $1.2B mkt cap but trades at a massive discount compared to its Chinese subsidiary (ACMS), which has a $5.9 billion market cap and trades at 6x 2025E revenue.

The report suggests that ACMR’s NASDAQ valuation is severely mispriced and could re-rate significantly as investors recognize the valuation gap.

Context: China/US chip war, you guys know what this is.

Sector Context: The global semiconductor industry is shifting, with China attempting to localize chip production.

Kerrisdale argues that restrictions on U.S. and Japanese WFE exports to China will only fuel ACMR’s growth as Chinese fabs increasingly turn to domestic suppliers.

China's WFE self-sufficiency has grown from 4% in 2019 to 17% in 2024 and is expected to reach 36% by 2026.

Risks: Geopolitical factors, including further U.S. export restrictions, could impact ACMR’s operations. Similar to how we have the NVDA trade restriction going on right now. However, Kerrisdale sees these restrictions as a net positive due to ACMR having less competition in China as a result. There are other players in the WFE space in China, but ACMR has a technological moat.

Ticker: [INTC](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=INTC&p=d)

Catalyst: Intel reported revenue of $14.26B vs exp of $13.81B. Most important, the company anticipated breakeven EPS next quarter.

Volume/Market Cap/Technicals: Somewhat rangebound for the past 3 months. Watching $20 but nothing interesting I'm watching beyond that.

Context: This earnings report is Intel's first since the departure of CEO Pat Gelsinger. Right now INTC is being led by two interim co-CEOs, and another price catalyst that could potentially happen is someone competent being picked lol. Also worth thinking of the NVDA/Deepseek/semiconductor news when reading through these catalysts.

Intel has also announced a delay in its Falcon Shores GPU and only using it internally within the company.

Risks: Intel faces significant competition from companies such as NVIDIA and AMD, the delay of their chip is pretty bad news.

Related Tickers: AMD/NVDA/TSM

Ticker: [ASTS](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ASTS&p=d)

Catalyst: ASTS has received special temporary authority from the FCC to test its space-based cellular broadband network in the United States. Allows for collaboration efforts with VZ/T.

Volume/Market Cap/Technicals: Slight rise, but will watch this at open to see if volume comes in.

Context: The FCC's authorization allows ASTS to provide cell/satellite comms, allowing for greater coverage and signals that more use of ASTS satellites. I remember that the company was essentially valued based on each satellite they launched successfully in 2024, whether that hype returns remains to be seen but overall not interested in trading this unless we have retail interest again.

Sector Context: SpaceX's Starlink is also entering the direct-to-cell market, as I noted a few days ago- most of the investment that can be done in these type of cell/sat comms in public markets can really only be done in ASTS.

Risks: If SpaceX IPOs we might see a selloff in this stock simply because SpaceX is far larger/established and Elon Musk has closer ties to the government.

Stocks,"Samsung fourth-quarter profit misses estimates, falls sharply from previous quarter","Samsung Electronics on Friday reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter revenue and operating profit, though its operating profit sharply dropped from last quarter.

Here are Samsung’s fourth-quarter results compared with LSEG SmartEstimate, which is weighted toward forecasts from analysts who are more consistently accurate:

Revenue: 75.8 trillion won vs. 75.4 trillion won

Operating profit: 6.5 trillion vs. 6.8 trillion won 

Revenue was about 12% up from the same period from last year, while operating profit grew about 130%, year on year.

However, operating profit fell nearly 30% to 6.5 trillion won.

Fourth-quarter revenue beat Samsung’s own guidance of 75 trillion Korean won, while operating profit came in line with the company’s forecast.

Samsung is a leading manufacturer of memory chips, which are utilized in devices such as laptops and servers, and is also the world’s second-largest player in the smartphone market.

Stocks,"Apple misses on iPhone revenue, sees 11% drop in China sales","Apple’s overall revenue rose by 4% in the first quarter, but it missed on Wall Street’s iPhone sales expectations and saw sales in China decline 11.1%, the company reported on Thursday. 

Here’s how Apple did versus LSEG consensus estimates for the quarter ending Dec. 28. 

Earnings per share: $2.40 vs. $2.35 estimated 

Revenue: $124.30 billion vs. $124.12 billion estimated 

 iPhone revenue: $69.14 billion vs. $71.03 billion estimated 

Mac revenue: $8.99 billion vs. $7.96 billion estimated 

iPad revenue: $8.09 billion vs. $7.32 billion estimated 

Other Products revenue: $11.75 billion vs. $12.01 billion estimated 

Services revenue: $26.34 billion vs. $26.09 billion estimated 

Gross margin: 46.9% vs. 46.5% estimated 

 Although Apple’s overall sales rose during the quarter, the company’s closely watched iPhone sales actually declined slightly on a year-over-year basis. The December quarter is the first full quarter with iPhone 16 sales, and Apple released its Apple Intelligence AI suite for the devices during the quarter.  

Apple’s iPhone miss versus LSEG estimates was the biggest for the company in two years, since its first-quarter earnings report in fiscal 2023. At the time, Apple said that its miss was because it was unable to make enough iPhone 14 models because of production issues in China. 

The company saw significant weakness in Greater China, which includes the mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Overall China sales declined 11.1% during the quarter to $18.51 billion. It’s the largest drop in China sales since the same quarter last year when they fell 12.9%. 

Apple CEO Tim Cook told CNBC’s Steve Kovach that iPhone sales were stronger in countries where Apple Intelligence is available. Currently, the software is only available in a handful of English-speaking countries, and it isn’t accessible in China or in Chinese. 

“During the December quarter, we saw that in markets where we had rolled out Apple intelligence, that the year-over-year performance on the iPhone 16 family was stronger than those markets where we had not rolled out Apple intelligence,” Cook said.  

Cook told CNBC that there were three factors in the company’s China performance. He said that half of the 11.1% decline was due to a change in “channel inventory,” the fact that Apple Intelligence hasn’t launched in the region and that after the quarter ended, China issued a national subsidy that would stimulate some Apple product sales.  

“If you look at the negative 11, half of the decline is due to a change in channel inventory, and so the operational performance is better,” Cook said. 

Apple executives usually give some color about how the current quarter is shaping up on a call with analysts. Wall Street is expecting guidance for the March quarter of $1.66 in earnings per share on $95.46 billion in revenue. 

The company reported $36.33 billion in net income during the quarter, up 7.1% from $33.92 billion in the same period last year. 

Apple’s iPad and Mac sales showed strong growth over last year’s struggling sales in the holiday quarter. Mac revenue rose 15% to $8.98 billion and iPad revenue grew 15% to $8.08 billion. 

The company released new Macs during the quarter, including new iMac, Mac Mini and MacBook Pro laptops in October, partially contributing to the growth. Apple also launched a new iPad Mini during the quarter. Cook attributed the growth to the new products.  

“It’s driven by the significant excitement around our latest Mac lineup,” Cook said.  

Apple’s profit engine, its Services division, which includes subscriptions, warranties and licensing deals, reported $23.12 billion in revenue, which is 14% higher than the same period last year. Cook said that the company had over 1 billion subscriptions, which includes both direct subscriptions for services like Apple TV+ and iCloud, as well as subscriptions to third-party apps through the company’s App Store system.  

The company’s “other products” category, also called Wearables, which includes Apple Watch, AirPods, Beats and Vision Pro sales, declined 2% on a year-over-year basis to $11.75 billion in sales. 

Apple said it would pay a dividend of 25 cents per share and spent $30 billion on dividends and share repurchases during the first quarter.

Stocks,Intel's revenue forecast disappoints as investors await new CEO,"Intel's (INTC.O), opens new tab first-quarter revenue forecast on Thursday missed analyst estimates, as the chipmaker grapples with tepid demand for traditional data center chips and declining share in the key personal computer market.

Shares of the Santa Clara, California-based company fell close to 2% in volatile extended trading. Last year, Intel's shares lost about 60%.

As the chipmaker undergoes a historic transition and attempts to emerge from one of its bleakest periods, it has also struggled to cash in on a boom in investment in advanced AI chips - a market led by Nvidia.

In its quarterly report after the bell, Intel said it expects first-quarter revenue of $11.7 billion to $12.7 billion, compared with analysts' average estimate of $12.87 billion according to data compiled by LSEG.

Companies looking to capitalize on generative AI technology have prioritized spending on specialized AI processors that can churn huge amounts of data, crimping demand for the traditional server processors that Intel sells.

The company's outlook ""reflects seasonal weakness magnified by macro uncertainties, further inventory digestion and competitive dynamics,"" interim co-CEO and chief financial officer David Zinsner said in a statement.

Intel last year scrapped a 2024 forecast that it would sell over $500 million worth of its new AI processors, named Gaudi, suggesting they struggled to compete against Nvidia's chips.

On an adjusted, per-share basis, Intel forecast it would break-even for the current quarter. Analysts expect adjusted profit of 9 cents per share.

It is spending heavily to become a contract manufacturer of chips for other companies, leading some investors to worry about pressure on its cash flows.

Former CEO Pat Gelsinger was ousted last month, leaving two temporary co-CEOs at the helm and shrouding Intel's turnaround strategy in uncertainty.

Intel reported fourth-quarter revenue fell 7% from a year earlier to $14.26 billion, beating estimates of $13.81 billion.

The PC market - Intel's largest by revenue share - saw global shipments rise only modestly last year, underperforming analysts' expectations of a strong rebound after months of declines.

The company has also been losing share in the PC and server CPU market to rival AMD.

Stocks,PayPal (PYPL): A Fintech Giant at an Inflection Point,"Overview of PayPal’s Market Position

PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: PYPL) remains a dominant force in the digital payments ecosystem. With over 400 million active users and deep integrations across major e-commerce platforms, PayPal has established itself as a key player in the financial technology sector. Despite this, its stock has faced headwinds, leading to a valuation that many analysts believe is undervalued relative to its historical trading range and fintech peers.

As of January 30, 2025, PayPal is trading at $90.08, reflecting a 1.49% increase from the previous close. From both a technical and fundamental perspective, the stock presents an intriguing case for potential investors.

Technical Analysis: Bullish Momentum Emerging

Key Moving Averages

20-Day SMA: $87.93 ✅ (Stock price above – bullish)

50-Day SMA: $87.71 ✅ (Stock price above – bullish)

100-Day SMA: $82.83 ✅ (Stock price above – strong momentum)

200-Day SMA: $73.23 ✅ (Stock price above – long-term bullish trend)


PayPal’s current price exceeding all major moving averages indicates a strong bullish trend, suggesting continued upside potential.

Key Technical Indicators

Relative Strength Index (RSI): 50.04 → Neutral, not overbought or oversold

MACD: 0.66 → Bearish signal, but improving trend

ADX: 15.29 → Buy signal, trend strengthening

CCI: 16.37 → Neutral


The RSI and CCI suggest that PayPal is in a neutral zone, meaning there is room for further price appreciation. The MACD remains slightly bearish but shows signs of improvement, while the ADX indicates a strengthening trend.

Support & Resistance Levels

Resistance:

R1: $91.22

R2: $92.21

R3: $94.12


Support:

S1: $88.32

S2: $86.41

S3: $85.42


Breaking through $91.22 could signal further upside, while strong support levels suggest downside protection in the mid-$80s.

Fundamental Strengths: A Long-Term Growth Story

1. Strong Cash Flow & Profitability

Unlike many high-growth fintech companies, PayPal remains cash-flow positive and profitable, enabling the company to invest in new initiatives, potential acquisitions, and stock buybacks.

2. AI-Driven Innovations & Fraud Prevention

PayPal is leveraging AI-driven fraud detection and personalized financial services, which not only improve security but also enhance customer retention and merchant adoption.

3. Venmo & Expanding Partnerships

Venmo’s expansion into business payments, tipping, and crypto transactions continues to drive new revenue streams. Additionally, PayPal maintains strong partnerships with Amazon, Uber, and major retailers, reinforcing its dominance in the digital payments space.

4. Crypto & Web3 Integration

PayPal has embraced cryptocurrency and blockchain, introducing PayPal USD (PYUSD) and expanding its role in crypto payments. This strategic move positions PayPal as an early leader in Web3 finance.

5. Valuation & Analyst Sentiment

67% of analysts rate PYPL as a Buy

Lower P/E ratio compared to fintech peers like Block (SQ) and Visa (V)

Stock trading significantly below historical highs, suggesting potential for revaluation


Conclusion: Is PayPal a Buy?

From a technical standpoint, PayPal appears to be building momentum, trading above key moving averages while maintaining strong support levels. A breakout above $91.22 could confirm further upside potential.

From a fundamental perspective, PayPal’s strong cash flow, AI-driven innovations, crypto adoption, and growing Venmo ecosystem position it for long-term success. Given its current valuation relative to competitors, the stock may present an attractive opportunity for investors with a mid-to-long-term horizon.

Investment Consideration:

✅ Bullish technical setup
✅ Resilient business model & strong cash flow
✅ Undervalued compared to peers
⚠️ MACD suggests caution in the short term
⚠️ Broader market conditions may impact fintech sentiment

Investors should watch for a break above $91.22, as well as any news on future stock buybacks, earnings growth, or additional fintech partnerships.

Stocks,Nvidia’s Prime time to buy,"
Stocks are emotional in nature. The Nvidia incident is no different.

I understand why tech took a big hit, the idea that something just became even 20x cheaper is crazy new advancement and could be what makes AI very profitable and productive.

The nvidia stock going down I believe was an overreaction. One thing to consider is that yes you now don’t need the best chips, but you still need chips and you may need a lot more now that the price has become so much more attractive. 

Keep in mind as well nvidia over 10 years has increase the efficiency and power of the chip by 2-3x.

Now there might be a demand for maybe not the newest chips but one that can be mass produced. 

Nvidia owns 98percent of the chip market. This reaction should’ve only happened had they overnight lost their monopoly.

I believe it’s a great time to buy as of current being at 119. 

It’s impossible to predict if it’ll go up or down however I’m optimistic about Nvidia buy more than I was the past year. 

Another thing I will
Mention is when did we ever start blindly believe government funded projects like DeepSeek from China and how much it actually cost and how much time was actually spent. Many of these questions are still a mystery. Either way I don’t think it’s a bad thing for Us tech…it just means they get to copy that format and continue making innovations 

Pessimists will say ai bubble has bursted 

Optimism will get you into denial mindsets 

But looking at the data and picking it up for what I consider cheap for a good company is I think a good play 

I’ll likely sell when it hits 135 and rebounds after people pick up their hats.

Stocks,Am I the only one that feels the market makes no sense right now?,"Ok so basically what I am trying to say is How in the world did Tesla just go up after missing the Earnings and all the stuff that's happened recently with Elon's salute and everything. I know tesla was never an automotive company and it is also in my opinion the most overvalued company on the market right now but this just doesn't make any sense.  
Also Microsoft, who beat the earning and also has a clear plan for this year just went down more than 6%. It just feels like the market is entirely random.

Stocks,These are the stocks on my watchlist (01/30),"This is a daily watchlist for short-term trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed!

I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments.

The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.

**Today OpenAI may make history. Trying out longer form, more detailed catalyst examinations over the short-form with more tickers.**

**Ticker:** [**META (Meta Inc)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=META&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Reported earnings of $8.02 vs $6.68 expected. Revenue of $48.4B vs $47B,but guided revenue short of consensus and didn't provide FY25 revenue outlook (which triggered the reason for the selloff post-earnings after the close).

Their CAPEX announcement was $60-65B vs $52.4B expected, and stated they expected the single largest driver of expesive growth in 2025 as infrastructure costs due to higher OpEX and depreciation.

Also announced plans to grow META's AI team significantly.

**Volume/Market Cap/Technicals:** Earnings move the stock on far less volume but the initial selloff after announcement was worth trading- interested in the $700 level today but not much beyond that.

**Context:** Decent earnings but signals that there is more spending on the horizon- likely that the initial brutal selloff to $606 was from algos just reading the initial eye-popping CAPEX number and selling the company.

**Sector Context:**There is a major next-level breakthrough that OpenAI is expected to release today that has agents performing on the same level as PHDs, Altman is meeting today with US government officials. META is the creator of Llama, which is another open source model compared to OpenAI's closed models.

**Risks:** Deepseek has been the main threat involved, with competitors from China using distillation and other AI techniques to be able to train a far cheaper model that brings up the question of why our large tech firms are spending so much on GPUs. (I'm sure this is news to you /s)

**Related Tickers:** FAANG stocks, SNAP, PINS, etc.

Offhand:  Something worth remembering is that there is a $10B undersea cable that spans over 40K km that they plan to build (unknown what the cable is for), more details coming in 2025. Likely some kind of fiber optic cable.

**Ticker:** [**TSLA (Tesla Inc.)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Reported earnings of $0.73 vs $0.76 expected. Revenue of $25.71B vs $27.23B expected. Most of this revenue miss came from miss in sale of EVs. 

TSLA announced interesting plans to lower the price of EVs in 2025 but also didn't give specific details regarding the production volume targets (as they have in the past), and also announced that there would be a paid robotaxi service in Austin in June. This puts them in competition with Waymo/UBER. Personally I think the vision-only approach is not viable in the long-run but hey, I'm no self-driving PHD. 

CAPEX was ALSO higher as with META due to spending increases from AI training infra costs and battery production capacity.

**Volume/Market Cap/Technicals:** I'm mainly interested in the $375/$400 level, not too interested in going long despite the multi-day slide in price.

**Context:** Main reason for TSLA's selloff was the lack of full-year guidance (it gives the subtext that it's too bad to release publically or it's up in the air). Political statements made by Musk may contribute to future issues for TSLA.

**Sector Context:** Revenue shortfall was caused due to lower-than-expected vehicle deliveries/ increased sale incentives, 496K cars vs 507K exp. China's BYD is rapidly catching up, and the (possible) removal of the US EV tax credit may make EV's more expensive

**Risks:** Mainly geopolitical- if the tariffs on EV vehicles imported to the US gets removed, TSLA will face fiercer competition from BYD. Also Elon Musk.

**Related Tickers:** BYD (but mainly trades in China, TSLA isn't as impacted by AI news.)



[**NVDA (NVIDIA Corporation) (in addition to ARM/AMD/SMH/SOXL/semiconductor stocks)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)

**Catalyst:** The reveal of Deepseek has introduced an AI model that rivals existing solutions but was developed at around $6M. However there's a rumor that Deepseek is actually trained on 50K H100 NVDA gpus.

**Yesterday after the close, there was an announcement Trump officials discussing tightening curbs on Nvidia's China sales.**

**Volume/Market Cap/Technicals:** Overall, there's been a massive selloff since NVDA was $150 at the end of last week. Overall interested again if we hit $116, but low confidence we'll sell off again. 

Currently long.

**Sector Context:** Not much to really say about this beyond NVDA having the most advanced chips that are widespread for training because of the CUDA architecture- most people are doubtful that the TOTAL cost was $6M

US Officials are examining export restrictions but China will likely find a way to bypass them as they have previously.

**Risks:** Mainly geopolitical, again. Obviously it's very difficult to restrict trade to a country that we have no military presence in or surround, and China is economically far more powerful than those we have attempted trade restrictions on in the past.

# [S&P 500 futures rise after Meta Platforms, Tesla report earnings: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/29/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
> S&P 500 futures rose Thursday as Wall Street digested recent quarterly results from a slew of megacap tech companies. Investors are coming off a losing session after the Federal Reserve held steady on rates.
*****
> Futures tied to the broad market index added 0.3%, while Nasdaq 100 futures advanced 0.5%. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were fractionally lower.
*****
> Shares of Meta Platforms and Tesla gained 1% and 2%, respectively, while Microsoft shares dipped more than 4% after the companies reported earnings. Meta beat on top and bottom lines, but Microsoft shares faltered after the company’s quarterly revenue forecast disappointed. Tesla shrugged off an earnings and revenue miss. On the other hand, revenue misses from UPS and Caterpillar weighed the indexes down.
*****
> Other “Magnificent Seven” names are set to report in the coming days, with Apple’s results being due for a Thursday release. Amazon will soon follow suit, as the megacap tech company reports next week.
*****
> On Wednesday, all three major averages ended the session lower as a 4% decline in Nvidia weighed on the market. The declines came after the Fed paused its interest rate-cutting campaign, leaving its borrowing rate unchanged in a range between 4.25% and 4.5%. In their post-meeting statement, policymakers noted that inflation remains “somewhat elevated.”
*****
> “The implication is that we’re on hold until the inflation rate goes down, and unfortunately it’s probably not going to go down very much in the several months ahead, so I wouldn’t be looking for rate cuts at the next meeting,” Jeffrey Gundlach, DoubleLine Capital CEO, said Wednesday on CNBC’s “Closing Bell.”
*****
> “We have a relatively stable place where we’re standing, and it kind of supports the fact that the market is in a calm position right now, and so is [Jerome] Powell apparently,” he said.
*****
> On the economic data front, the fourth-quarter gross domestic product reading is due on Thursday, and weekly jobless claims are out in the morning. Investors are also looking ahead to Friday’s personal consumption expenditures price index report for December.

Stocks,UPS Shares Sink on Disappointing Forecast for Parcel Demand,">United Parcel Service Inc. projected annual revenue well below expectations, telling investors that a long-awaited rebound in demand for its parcel services won’t arrive this year.

>The courier forecast revenue of $89 billion for 2025, compared with the average analyst expectation of $94.9 billion. It said Thursday that 2024 revenue came in at $91.1 billion.

>Shares of UPS fell as much as 14% in premarket trading in New York. The stock had risen about 6% this year, but declined 20% in 2024 — marking a third year of declines.

>UPS’ core parcel operations have endured a long-lasting demand trough and the steady untethering of its largest customer, [Amazon.com](http://Amazon.com) Inc. Package volumes have fallen from pandemic-era peaks as companies and retail consumers rely less on parcel shipments. Some customers also have traded down from premium to economy services, cutting into the Atlanta-based company’s earnings.

>Adjusted fourth-quarter earnings came to $2.75 a share, the company said Thursday in a statement. Analysts had predicted $2.53 per share on average, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The beat was driven by higher demand and prices during the end-of-year holiday shipping rush.

>

>Volumes showed the start of a rebound when the company reported earnings in October, an inflection that now looks like a blip of optimism amid an ongoing slump.

>The company said it had reached an agreement with its largest customer — widely understood to be Amazon — to lower volumes by more than 50% by the second half of 2026. That came as a surprise, said Daniel Imbro, an analyst at Stephens Inc.

>“This does fit with their strategy of better, not bigger,” Imbro said by email. “But it appears to be a headwind to earnings, given the lack of underlying revenue growth.”

>The move is part of an effort to reduce the amount of low-value packages in UPS’ network in favor of “growing in the best parts of the market,” Chief Executive Officer Carol Tomé said in Thursday’s statement.

>

>UPS has tried to counteract the slowdown in shipping volumes by cutting costs where it can. The company is in the process of shuttering some facilities around the US and refurbishing others to make way for automation that could help save on labor costs in the future. In 2024, UPS permanently closed 11 facilities and completed 49 operational closures, the company said in a presentation.

>UPS is also planning a multi-year redesign of its network to go after $1 billion in savings. A costly contract with the Teamsters union has led the company to look for ways to offset that burden, partly by winning back customers who fled to rival carriers amid rocky labor negotiations in 2023.

>The company has aggressively raised prices and implemented surcharges. Simultaneously, it’s going after higher-margin business by expanding its health-care vertical and aiming for $20 billion in revenue in the segment by 2026.

Stocks,SoftBank’s Potential $2.5 Billion Investment in OpenAI – What Could This Mean for AI Stocks?,"SoftBank is reportedly in talks to invest $2.5 billion in OpenAI, further expanding its AI ambitions. This potential deal, first reported by the Financial Times, comes at a time when AI driven companies are seeing massive capital inflows.

Some key takeaways:

	•	SoftBank’s AI Strategy: Led by Masayoshi Son, SoftBank has been a key player in tech investments, with its Vision Fund backing several AI startups. This move aligns with their long-term strategy in AI.

	•	Impact on AI Stocks: With OpenAI already backed by Microsoft (MSFT), an additional investment from SoftBank could signal confidence in AI’s future growth. Could this push AI-related stocks even higher?

	•	Market Implications: AI investments have been a strong bullish signal in recent months. Companies involved in AI infrastructure, cloud computing, and semiconductor production (like Nvidia (NVDA)) could benefit from increased AI adoption.

	•	SoftBank’s Investment Shift: After selling a stake in Arm Holdings (ARM), SoftBank seems to be redirecting capital into AI. Could this indicate a longterm bet on AI dominance?

Stocks,Meta shares up 4% after company beats on revenue,"Link: [Meta Q4 earnings report 2024](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/29/meta-q4-earnings-report-2024.html)

[Meta](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/META/) shares were flat after the company reported fourth-quarter earnings that beat on the top and bottom.

Here’s how the company did, compared with estimates from analysts polled by LSEG:

* **Earnings per share**: $8.02 vs. $6.77
* **Revenue**: $48.39 billion vs. $47.04 billion

On a call with analysts, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg explained some of the rationale for the company’s recent efforts to [improve its relationship](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/11/meta-had-to-bend-the-knee-to-trump-ahead-of-inauguration.html) with President Donald Trump and the current White House administration.

“We now have a US administration that is proud of our leading companies, prioritizes American technology winning, and that will defend our values and interests abroad, and I am optimistic about the progress and innovation that this can unlock,” Zuckerberg said. “So this is going to be a big year.”

Meta said its first-quarter revenue would be in the range of $39.5 billion to $41.8 billion. The midpoint of that figure trailed analysts’ expectations of first-quarter revenue of $41.73 billion.

Meta’s fourth-quarter sales grew 21% year over year while its net income was $20.84.

The company said that daily active people came in at 3.35 billion in the quarter, up from 3.29 billion the previous quarter. Wall Street was projecting 3.32 billion for the fourth quarter.

Meta said that its first quarter costs and [expenses](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/24/zuckerberg-sets-metas-ai-targets-for-the-year-expects-to-spend-60-billion-on-growth.html) were $25.02 billion, representing a more than 5% increase from the prior year.

Meta reiterated last Friday’s announcement that it would invest between $60 billion and $65 billion in capital expenditures in 2025 to fuel its AI strategy.

Meta did not provide a revenue outlook for 2025, but investments in the company’s core business “will give us an opportunity to continue delivering strong revenue growth throughout 2025,” finance chief Susan Li said in a statement.

The company expects its total expenses for 2025 to come in between $114 billion to $119 billion, with the bulk of the spending related to its infrastructure costs, Meta said. The company plans to hire workers for infrastructure, monetization, Reality Labs, generative artificial intelligence, regulation and compliance.  

The company’s headcount grew to more than 74,000 at the end of December, up 10% year over year.","['META', 'META', 'META', 'META', 'META', 'META', 'META', 'META', 'META', 'META']",395,169,106,2025-01-29 22:20:18+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1id6e2z/meta_shares_up_4_after_company_beats_on_revenue/,0.9832

*****

# [Stock futures are little changed as investors await Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/28/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
> Stock futures were near the flatline on Wednesday as investors turned toward the first Federal Reserve interest rate decision of 2025.
*****
> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average inched down 13 points. Nasdaq 100 futures were 0.3% higher, while S&P 500 futures was trading around the flatline.
*****
> Tech stocks on Tuesday led the S&P 500 higher and brought the Nasdaq Composite to a 2% gain. The two indexes made a comeback after incurring sharp losses on Monday in a sell-off spurred by the emergence of China’s DeepSeek and the threat it poses to the artificial intelligence trade. Nvidia, which suffered a roughly 17% decline Monday, jumped nearly 9% on Tuesday.
*****
> “As far as the DeepSeek news over the weekend, at the end of the day today, there really hasn’t been that much of an impact on a market-wide basis,” Bespoke Investment Group co-founder Paul Hickey said Tuesday on CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime.”
*****
> The Fed’s interest rate decision on Wednesday is now a focal point for investors, as well as Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s press conference. Fed funds futures data reflect a nearly 100% certainty that the central bank will keep rates steady at a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%, according to CME Group data.
*****
> “When it comes to the Fed, they’re widely not expected to do anything tomorrow and that’s a good thing. The less the Fed has to do, the better it is for the market, in our view,” Hickey added.
*****
> Investors will be paying especially close attention to Powell’s comments — his first press conference in President Donald Trump’s second term. The two have had a contentious relationship dating back to Trump’s first term. The president has already said he would “demand that interest rates drop immediately.”
*****
> A volley of Big Tech earnings are due Wednesday afternoon, with Meta Platforms, Microsoft and Tesla issuing their quarterly reports.

i've got some hesitation. I always wanted to pick 2-3 stock in pure AI tech to boost my exposition on US tech.  I've got 50-60% Tech ETF (world tech and nasdaq). But i would like to bet on 2-3 picks which can make the difference in 2025 and the dip is ""exciting"",  but i feel like a doubt in the market.

Some says Broadcomm and Marvell look ""risky"" after the dip... I got Nvidia but Trump tarriff and the trouble about the cost of AI chipset in the context where big investor criticize more and more the yield of IA... So i guess in the medium term, nvidia will be less profitable. 

So what do you think ? the last time i took 2 stock pick, i lost 10% in two day (AMD et Cheniere), so i would like to get more advice lol

Stocks,Is SMCI SMUGGLING NVIDIA GPUS to CHINA?!?!?,"Gather 'round, I've stumbled upon some juicy DD that's bad news for any $SMCI bulls.

Yesterday, a video surfaced on X, of a Chinese entrepreneur bragging about getting 200 NVIDIA H200 GPUs despite the export ban, claiming that he's done so for the past 5 year.

But where the story gets really interesting is when the video shows him pulling the NVIDA H200s out from a fresh delivery, which clearly shows $SMCI logo on the boxes he received...

https://preview.redd.it/di3dhpvf6vfe1.png?width=1249&format=png&auto=webp&s=a958013deb8bf7b78988c8b6b3918e733a99a43f

Now before any $SMCI bulls go panic-denial mode, let's put this into context:

* \*\*2018:\*\*$SMCI gets yeeted off Nasdaq for ""losing"" its financial statements. 
* **2020: SEC Slapdown:** $17.5 million fine for widespread accounting violations. The bill is paid, and 3 months later $SMCI rehires the same execs directly involved in the fraud numbers
* **2024:**
   * Hindenburg drops a DD bomb, accusing them of *still* mishandling their numbers, even accusing SMCI of ""violations in US export bans""... interesting
   *  Ernst & Young resign as SMCI's auditor after raising concerns about the company's accounting practices, board management... maybe they picked up on rumors of an additional revenue stream that was hidden in the books as well, who knows.
* **Lawsuits, Lawsuits Everywhere:** Ex-employees whisteblowers continue reporting falsified revenue numbers and other sus accounting practices. 10-k gets ""misplaced"", nice one

And now this video. Definitely not the PR $SMCI needs right now.

Could this be a coincidence? Unlikely. But sure, let's assume $SMCI is just an innocent pawn in this Chinese GPU smuggling game without ever realizing, the accusation alone could trigger a huge sell off. DeepSeek's roll out sent a wake up to the US: we've lost the lead in our own game. The China-US Ai competition has now taken central focus of the government and stock market alike, so imagine how this news will impact an already-beaten down stock with new accusations cropping up each week.","['NVDA', 'NVDA']",359,75,51,2025-01-29 05:02:20+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1icmat5/is_smci_smuggling_nvidia_gpus_to_china/,-0.9425

Stocks,Apple and SpaceX Link Up to Support Starlink Satellite Network on iPhones,"**Thoughts:** Obviously good for companies that are involved in the sat comm business (but may be bad/neutral for sat comm companies that do not work with AAPL such as GSAT), TMUS, and AAPL. TSLA is also possibly affected because SpaceX trades as a proxy to TSLA news. VZ/T/other phone providers may be affected but the use case is so niche that I won't hold my breath. 

>Apple Inc. has been secretly working with SpaceX and T-Mobile US Inc. to add support for the Starlink network in its latest iPhone software, providing an alternative to the company’s in-house satellite-communication service.

>

>The companies have been testing iPhones with the Starlink service from Elon Musk’s Space Exploration Technologies Corp., according to people with knowledge of the matter. In an under-the-radar move, the smartphone’s latest software update — released Monday — now supports the technology.

>

>The tie-up comes as a surprise: T-Mobile has previously only specified Starlink as an option for Samsung Electronics Co. phones, such as the Z Fold and S24 models. Apple, meanwhile, already provides a Globalstar Inc. offering that lets consumers send texts and contact emergency responders when out of cellular range.

>

>T-Mobile has begun allowing customers to sign up for an early version of the Starlink service, and this week the carrier enabled a small number of iPhones as part of a beta test.

>

>The first users received text messages from T-Mobile saying, “You’re in the T-Mobile Starlink beta. You can now stay connected with texting via satellite from virtually anywhere. To start experiencing coverage beyond, please update to iOS 18.3.” Users in the program have a new toggle switch in their iPhone cellular data settings to manage the satellite feature.

>

>An Apple spokesperson declined to comment, while T-Mobile said that the test will “begin with select optimized smartphones” and that the full launch will “support the vast majority of modern smartphones.” T-Mobile has also opened the beta to some users running Android 15, the latest version of the Google operating system. A representative for SpaceX didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

>

>Ever since Apple teamed up with Globalstar to offer satellite features in 2022, there’s been speculation over whether it might support competing networks. The day after Apple’s 2022 announcement, Musk posted on X that his company has “had some promising conversations with Apple about Starlink connectivity.”

>

>Here’s how it will work: When a T-Mobile iPhone is in an area without cellular connectivity, devices that are part of the Starlink program will first try to pair with SpaceX satellites. Users will also be able to enable texting via the satellite menu for the Globalstar service or contact emergency services through Apple.

>

>The initial version of Starlink is exclusively for texting. But SpaceX and T-Mobile have said that they plan to expand into data connections and voice calls in the future. The program also is only available in the US for now. That contrasts with Apple’s Globalstar service, which works in several countries. SpaceX is looking to expand Starlink to other carriers globally.

>

>There’s another major difference between the two services. The current Apple feature requires users to point their iPhone to the sky to find a satellite. The Starlink option, meanwhile, is designed to work automatically — even when the phone is in a customer’s pocket.

>

>Both the Starlink and Apple satellite features are designed to work in off-the-grid areas, such as hiking trails, that don’t have cellular service. The capabilities can’t be used in places where a mobile-phone network is within reach. Support for the Apple feature is available on most current iPhone models and the company plans to bring it to its Ultra smartwatch later this year, Bloomberg News has reported.

>

>T-Mobile updated its website this week to tell beta testers that the iPhone is supported as part of the iOS 18.3 software release. As of now, the number of users in the beta is minimal, with T-Mobile planning to expand the program in February. Apple’s announcement of iOS 18.3 touted AI features and bug fixes, but it didn’t disclose the Starlink support.

>

>SpaceX requested authority to begin beta-testing the service starting Monday. The Federal Communications Commission granted SpaceX conditional approval for its satellites to supplement T-Mobile’s cellular network in November.

Stocks,"Starbucks earnings top estimates, but same-store sales decline for fourth straight quarter","Starbucks on Tuesday reported that its same-store sales slid for the fourth consecutive quarter, but the company’s quarterly earnings and revenue beat Wall Street’s expectations.

The coffee giant kicked off a turnaround plan last quarter in the hopes of reviving its U.S. business, which has slumped over the last year.

“While we have room for improvement, we’re making progress as planned, and have confidence we’re on the right track,” CEO Brian Niccol said in a video released on the company’s website on Tuesday afternoon.

Here’s what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: 69 cents vs. 67 cents expected

Revenue: $9.4 billion vs. $9.31 billion expected

The company’s net sales of $9.4 billion were unchanged from a year earlier.

The company’s same-store sales fell 4%, fueled by a 6% decline in traffic to its stores. Wall Street was expecting a steeper drop of 5.5%, according to StreetAccount estimates. Both its U.S. and international locations outperformed expectations.

U.S. same-store sales slid 4% as traffic to its cafes fell 8%. Under Niccol, who took the reins in September, the company has been trying to turn around its U.S. business by getting “back to Starbucks” and returning its focus to coffee and the customer experience.

Outside of its home market, same-store sales also declined 4%.

Starbucks’ same-store sales in China, its second-largest market, fell 6%, fueled by a 4% in average ticket. The coffee giant has been leaning into discounts in China to compete with rivals that have much lower prices, like Luckin Coffee.

Stocks,Bridgewater sees short-term correction for tech stocks but bullish on DeepSeek impact By Reuters,"""Bridgewater sees short-term correction for tech stocks but bullish on DeepSeek impact""

https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/bridgewater-sees-shortterm-correction-for-tech-stocks-but-bullish-on-deepseek-impact-3834767



  Hedge fund manager Bridgewater Associates said Chinese startup DeepSeek's launch of its latest artificial intelligence (AI) models could lead to a short-term correction in many tech companies' share prices but is positive for the industry.

The comments come amid a tech stocks sell-off prompted by the release of a free AI assistant launched by DeepSeek last week that the startup said uses less data at a fraction of the cost of services currently available.

DeepSeek's AI Assistant has overtaken rival ChatGPT to become the top-rated free application available on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s App Store in the United States, raising doubts about the reasoning behind some U.S. tech companies' decision to pledge billions of dollars in AI investment.

""DeepSeek’s progress is big news, but not bad news for most of the AI ecosystem,"" Bridgewater said in a note on Monday authored by Co-Chief Investment Officer Greg Jensen and Jas Sekhon, chief scientist of AIA Labs, a division within the hedge fund focused on developing and utilizing AI and machine learning technologies to generate investment strategies and insights.

DeepSeek threatens share prices for many tech stocks in the short term, Bridgewater said.

""This may be especially true for Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), because DeepSeek’s success may encourage companies to invest more in achieving efficiency gains by optimizing how AI software interacts with the hardware,"" said the note.

Shares in Nvidia, a leader in the AI chip market, fell 17% on Monday, wiping $593 billion from its market value - a record one-day loss for any company - and dragged U.S. stocks lower. That drop was partly corrected on Tuesday, with Nvidia shares up around 5% in premarket trading.

> Jan 28 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump plans to impose tariffs on imported computer chips, pharmaceuticals and steel, he said on Monday, to push companies to manufacture more in the United States.
> 
> The comments mark the latest in a number of trade-related threats unleashed by Trump in recent days. He has already promised to slap 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico by Feb. 1 if the two countries don't meet demands on border security and other issues.
> 
> By focusing on chips and pharmaceuticals, Trump could squeeze U.S. allies in Asia, including Taiwan, South Korea and Japan.
> 
> **WHAT'S BEING TARGETED FOR CHIPS?**
> 
> Trump said he plans to impose tariffs on imported computer chips without providing details.
> Asia is the world's biggest chip manufacturing hub, producing more than 80% of semiconductors sold globally, according to the Asian Development Bank.
> 
> Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world's largest contract chipmaker, makes semiconductors for Nvidia, Apple and other U.S. clients. TSMC generated 70% of its revenue in 2024 from customers based in North America.
> 
> While it is building a $65 billion manufacturing facility in Arizona, the bulk of TSMC's production remains in Taiwan, with exports to the U.S. theoretically subject to tariffs.
> 
> **WHAT ABOUT OTHER CHIPS?**
> 
> Asian producers also dominate the market for memory chips, with DRAM and NAND flash chips used in electronic devices including computers.
> 
> South Korea's Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix together control around three quarters of the global DRAM market.
> 
> The two companies, plus Japan's Kioxia, which is controlled by U.S. buyout firm Bain Capital, command a similar market share in NAND flash.
> 
> Samsung is investing roughly $44 billion in chipmaking facilities in Texas with subsidies from the U.S. government.
> 
> **WHAT ABOUT THE ECONOMIC HIT?**
> 
> Chips are a major source of export revenue for South Korea and Taiwan, meaning there's a lot more at stake than just the impact on manufacturers themselves.
> 
> South Korea's exports of semiconductors hit a record $141.9 billion in 2024, of which $10.28 billion was to the U.S., according to data released by the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy earlier this month.
> 
> **WHAT ABOUT OTHER CHIP SUPPLY CHAIN COMPANIES?**
> 
> Japan is a major supplier of chipmaking equipment and materials, all of which, at least for now, appear to have avoided direct mention by Trump. Major equipment companies include Tokyo Electron and Advantest.
> 
> **WHAT ABOUT PHARMA?**
> 
> Imposing tariffs on imported pharmaceuticals could weigh on Japan, home of major drugmakers such as Takeda, Astellas, Daiichi Sankyo and Eisai, which has been expecting strong sales growth in the U.S. of its Alzheimer's disease drug Leqembi.
> 
> For Takeda, the U.S. market accounted for just over half of its revenue in last financial year, while for Astellas it accounted for 41%. In both cases it wasn't clear how much of the U.S. revenue came from imports.

Stocks,"Former Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger is already using DeepSeek instead of OpenAI at his startup, Gloo","DeepSeek’s new open source AI reasoning model, R1, sparked a sell-off of Nvidia’s stock and caused its consumer app to soar to the top of the app stores.
Last month DeepSeek said it trained a model using a data center of some 2,000 of Nvidia’s H800 GPUs in just about two months at a cost of around $5.5 million. Last week, it published a paper showing that its latest model’s performance matched the most advanced reasoning models in the world. These models are being trained in data centers that are spending billions on Nvidia’s faster, very pricey AI chips.
The reaction across the tech industry to DeepSeek’s high-performance, lower-cost model has been wild. Pat Gelsinger, for instance, took to X with glee, posting, “Thank you DeepSeek team.” 


Gelsinger is, of course, the recently former CEO of Intel, a hardware engineer, and current chairman of his own IPO-bound startup, Gloo, a messaging and engagement platform for churches. He left Intel in December after four years and an attempt at chasing Nvidia with Intel’s alternative AI GPUs, the Gaudi 3 AI.
Gelsinger wrote that DeepSeek should remind the tech industry of its three most important lessons: lower costs mean wider-spread adoption; ingenuity flourishes under constraints; and “Open Wins. DeepSeek will help reset the increasingly closed world of foundational AI model work,” he wrote. OpenAI and Anthropic are both closed source.
Gelsinger told TechCrunch that R1 is so impressive, Gloo has already decided not to adopt and pay for OpenAI. Gloo is building an AI service called Kallm, which will offer a chatbot and other services.
“My Gloo engineers are running R1 today,” he said. “They could’ve run o1 — well, they can only access o1, through the APIs.” 

Instead, in two weeks, Gloo expects to have rebuilt Kallm from scratch “with our own foundational model that’s all open source,” he said. “That’s exciting.”
He said he thinks DeepSeek will make AI so affordable, AI won’t just be everywhere. Good AI will be everywhere. “I want better AI in my Oura Ring. I want better AI in my hearing aid. I want more AI in my phone. I want better AI in my embedded devices, like the voice recognition in my EV,” he says. 
Gelsinger’s happy reaction was perhaps at odds with others who were less thrilled that reasoning foundational models now have a higher-performing and far more affordable challenger. AI has been growing more expensive, not less.
Others reacted by implying DeepSeek must have fudged its numbers somehow and training must have been more costly. Some thought it couldn’t say it used higher-end chips because of U.S. AI chip export restrictions to China. Others were poking holes in its performance, finding spots where other models did better. Still others believe that OpenAI’s next model, o3, will so outpace R1 when it is released that the status quo will be repaired.
Gelsinger shrugs all of that off. “You will never have full transparency, given most of the work was done in China,” he said. “But still, all evidence is that it’s 10-50x cheaper in their training than o1.”
DeepSeek proves that AI can be moved forward “by engineering creativity, not throwing more hardware power and compute resources at the problem. So that’s thrilling,” he said.
As for this being a Chinese developer with all that implies, like concerns over privacy and censorship, Gelsinger metaphorically shakes his head.
“Having the Chinese remind us of the power of open ecosystems is maybe a touch embarrassing for our community, for the Western world,” he said.

Stocks,"Starbucks shakes up its leadership again, adding two former Taco Bell executives","Starbucks announced another stage in its leadership shakeup on Tuesday, as CEO Brian Niccol will bring in two more executives who spent time at his former employer Taco Bell while dividing key leadership roles.

“As we focus on our ‘Back to Starbucks’ plan, we need a new operating model for our retail team, with clear ownership and accountability and an appropriate scope for each role,” Niccol said in a letter to employees shared on the company’s website.

Before spending six years at Chipotle, Niccol served as CEO of Yum Brands’ Taco Bell. Since starting at Starbucks in September, he’s already poached some of his former colleagues to help with his transformation of the coffee giant. For example, he tapped Chipotle and Yum Brands alum Tressie Lieberman as Starbucks’ global chief brand office in the fall.

The newest changes to the Starbucks organization include splitting the role of North American president into two jobs; the company’s current North American president, Sara Trilling, will depart the company. Trilling has been with Starbucks since 2002.

Starting in February, Meredith Sandland will hold the role of chief store development officer. Sandland is currently CEO of Empower Delivery, a restaurant software company. Previously, she served as chief operating officer of Kitchen United and as Taco Bell’s chief development officer.

Additionally, Mike Grams will join the company in February as North America chief stores officer. Grams has been with Taco Bell for more than 30 years, starting as a restaurant general manager and working his way up to become the chain’s global chief operating officer, according to his LinkedIn.

Both Sandland and Grams will be tasked with implementing Niccol’s vision to go “back to Starbucks.” The strategy includes decreasing service times to four minutes per order, making its stores more welcoming and cozy and slashing the menu.

Arthur Valdez, Starbucks’ chief supply officer, also plans to leave the company. He joined in 2023 after seven years at Target. Starbucks has already identified his replacement and will share that news in the coming weeks, Niccol said in the letter.

Starbucks is expected to report its fiscal first-quarter earnings after the bell on Tuesday. Wall Street is expecting the company’s same-store sales to fall for the fourth consecutive quarter as consumers in the U.S. and China opt to get their caffeine fix elsewhere.

Recently disclosed text messages reveal that Elon Musk tried to sway Norway’s massive sovereign wealth fund—commonly known as the Oil Fund—to support his controversial Tesla pay package. The fund, which manages assets of around USD 1.8 trillion and holds a significant stake in Tesla, voted against Musk’s compensation proposal, prompting him to admonish CEO Nicolai Tangen not to request any “favors” until making amends.

In their exchange, Musk also accused Tangen of leaking the texts to the media, after Norwegian outlets reported on his canceled dinner appearance at the Oil Fund’s investment conference. Tangen countered that Norway’s strict transparency laws, akin to the U.S. Freedom of Information Act, required partial disclosure, including confirmation that Musk would not attend.

Initially, the Oil Fund classified much of the conversation as private and withheld it. However, in the spirit of transparency, they eventually released all texts. The incident highlights the tension between Musk’s calls for discretion and the Norwegian Oil Fund’s legal obligations to remain open. While emphasizing a positive relationship with Tesla as a critical investment, the fund has reiterated its opposition to Musk’s pay plan.","['TSLA', 'TSLA', 'TSLA', 'TSLA']",3382,187,131,2025-01-28 14:20:45+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ic2lgt/elon_musk_tried_to_pressure_norways_wealth_funda/,0.9001

* Company burned through more than $14 billion in cash 

Boeing Co. Chief Executive Officer Kelly Ortberg said he will realign the company around key business lines and cleave off fringe assets, setting in motion a portfolio overhaul after the US planemaker emerged from a tumultuous and deeply unprofitable year.

The company has made progress in its turnaround, adjusting its factories and supplier base for higher production levels going forward, and addressing money-losing defense programs, Ortberg said in memo to employees as Boeing reported a fourth-quarter $4 billion operating loss. Fixing cultural dysfunction will be “a multi-year journey,” he said.

“We are also preparing for the path ahead by continuing to make investments in our core businesses while streamlining our portfolio in areas that are not core to our future,” said the CEO, who took over in August in the wake of a management shake-up.

The US planemaker’s dismal fourth-quarter results, parts of which it announced late last week, underscore the urgency for Ortberg to pull Boeing out of a six-year nose dive. The company burned through a total of $14.3 billion of free cash during a calamitous year marked by near-catastrophe on an airborne 737 Max, leadership turmoil, federal investigations and a lengthy worker strike.

“The big story really is about the future of this company,” said George Ferguson, an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. The pre-announcement moved “the narrative of the day from what are the numbers to a very forward-looking discussion of the company.”

The operating loss per share was $5.90 for the quarter, while analysts had expected a core loss of $3.07, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. For the year, the company lost $20.38 per share, one of the worst showings in its history, and Boeing’s sixth straight annual deficit.

The CEO, along with Chief Financial Officer Brian West, is set to provide more detail around the defense charges and Boeing’s portfolio review during a conference call later Tuesday. Ortberg didn’t identify any assets that might be cut. The company also refrained from providing a financial outlook for the year.

The earnings put the spotlight on the troubled defense and space business, which racked up additional charges on programs including the mid-air refueling tanker and the new Air Force One presidential jet.

Among possible divestments is the Jeppesen navigation unit, which is attracting major aviation suppliers and private equity suitors and could fetch $6 billion to $8 billion for Boeing, people familiar with the talks have said.

The CEO faces a drawn-out recovery as he works to settle Boeing’s factories back into the steady operating tempo that was the norm before two 737 Max crashes in 2018 and early 2019 and the Covid pandemic hammered suppliers. But new challenges loom as Ortberg works to shore up Boeing’s quality controls and finances amid a leadership vacuum at the Federal Aviation Administration and uncertainty over global trade under the Trump Administration.

“As I’ve visited our global sites, it’s clear that we all want to help get Boeing back to the company we know it can be,” Ortberg told employees in the memo.

After raising about $34 billion in debt and equity in 2024, the US manufacturer should have a cushion as it slogs through operational difficulties that span its commercial and defense portfolios. Boeing ended the year with $26.3 billion in cash and short-term securities after pre-paying $3.5 billion of debt that is due in May.

Ortberg reiterated that Boeing is prioritizing the health of its production system and ensuring that suppliers can support any step-ups in jetliner output. The US manufacturer returned to producing five of its widebody 787 Dreamliners per month in December, Ortberg said, a target it initially set for the end of 2023.

For a second consecutive quarter, Boeing gave investors advance warning of disappointing results that were affected by a prolonged strike by 33,000 hourly workers in the final quarter of last year. The earnings included almost $3 billion in charges, including a larger-than-expected $1.7 billion accounting loss for the defense, space and security business.

Company officials have completed deep dives into five fixed-price defense and space programs, and Boeing is now “more proactive and clear-eyed on the risks,” Ortberg said.said he will realign the company around key business lines and cleave off fringe assets, setting in motion a portfolio overhaul after the US planemaker emerged from a tumultuous and deeply unprofitable year.

The company has made progress in its turnaround, adjusting its factories and supplier base for higher production levels going forward, and addressing money-losing defense programs, Ortberg said in memo to employees as Boeing reported a fourth-quarter $4 billion operating loss. Fixing cultural dysfunction will be “a multi-year journey,” he said.

Thoughts: BA posted a brutal loss for Q4 but the CEO laid out a recovery plan for the company that focuses on core businesses. This has been the SIXTH consecutive annual loss they've posted. (They've also been delayed by the machinist strike). Still don't think it's investible.

# [S&P 500 futures are flat as Nvidia attempts to rebound from AI stock rout: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/27/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
> S&P 500 futures were relatively unchanged early Tuesday, following a sell-off fueled by worries over the emergence of Chinese startup DeepSeek and its greater implications for the artificial intelligence trade.
*****
> Futures tied to the S&P 500, along with Nasdaq 100 futures, traded just above the flatline, rising 0.1%. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were also flat.
*****
> Futures were trading in step with Nvidia in the premarket, with both trading off their highs during the session. Nvidia added around 2% after suffering a nearly 17% decline on Monday, which resulted in a market cap loss of nearly $600 billion — the biggest one-day drop for a U.S. company in history. Broadcom and Oracle also traded higher by more than 2% and around 1%, respectively.
*****
> Concerns over DeepSeek came to a head on Monday, with the Nasdaq Composite losing more than 3%, while the S&P 500 slid about 1.5%. The Chinese startup last month unveiled a free open-source large language model that it says took less than $6 million to build. The development spurred worries around Big Tech’s investment into AI. DeepSeek surpassed rival OpenAI on Monday to become the most-downloaded free app in the U.S. on Apple’s App Store.
*****
> “Valuations remain extended, and while vulnerabilities were expected this year, developments like DeepSeek highlight the need for diversification beyond the Mag Seven,” said Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management. “The 2025 theme of US exceptionalism is now facing uncertainty, with ongoing concerns around tariffs and inflation adding to market challenges.”
*****
> Investors’ attention is turning toward corporate earnings due this week. Starbucks is due to report Tuesday after the bell. A slate of Magnificent Seven companies will report in the coming days, with Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Tesla and Apple due later this week.
*****
> The Federal Reserve will also kick off its two-day policy meeting on Tuesday. Fed funds futures are pricing in a more than 99% chance that interest rates will remain unchanged, according to CMEGroup’s FedWatch Tool. Inflation data out Friday will give investors further insight on the health of the U.S. economy.

Stocks,Comprehensive Analysis of DeepSeek R1 and Its Impact on U.S. Equities and Global AI Market,"1. Introduction to DeepSeek R1 and the AI Revolution

DeepSeek R1 is an AI model introduced by DeepSeek Technologies, which has made waves for its cost-effective approach to AI model training and the integration of quantum-inspired algorithms. This model presents a significant disruption to the traditional AI ecosystem dominated by major players like Nvidia, OpenAI, and Google. The release of DeepSeek R1 has not only sparked a wave of innovation in AI model development but has also created new competitive dynamics in U.S. equities and the global tech market.

DeepSeek R1’s success hinges on its ability to provide a more affordable and efficient alternative to training large language models (LLMs), which have been known for their high costs, both in terms of computational power and energy consumption. By lowering these barriers, DeepSeek R1 has opened up new opportunities for AI developers, researchers, and companies looking to deploy AI at scale.

This analysis will examine the impact of DeepSeek R1 on U.S. equities, particularly focusing on the broader effects on AI hardware and software companies, such as Nvidia, Google, Microsoft, and startups in the AI space. We will also explore the technological implications, competitive shifts, and broader macroeconomic trends linked to DeepSeek R1’s innovation.

2. Technological Innovations of DeepSeek R1

DeepSeek R1 introduces several groundbreaking technologies that contribute to its efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Understanding these innovations is essential to grasping the broader implications of this model on both the AI industry and the stock market.

2.1 Hybrid Computational Approach: Classical and Quantum Integration

One of the core innovations of DeepSeek R1 is its hybrid approach, which blends classical AI techniques with quantum-inspired optimization methods. This integration allows the model to achieve higher efficiency in training without the need for fully quantum computers, which are still nascent in development.

In traditional AI model training, large neural networks like GPT-4 rely on massively parallel processing systems, such as Nvidia’s GPUs, which can be expensive to operate and require significant energy resources. DeepSeek R1, by contrast, reduces the computational complexity of training algorithms, achieving faster results with less energy consumption.

For instance, training a model of similar size to GPT-4 could take days on traditional systems, but DeepSeek R1’s optimization algorithms allow for the same task to be completed in half the time. This reduction in training time is crucial for businesses looking to scale AI applications more affordably.

2.2 Cost-Efficiency and Speed

DeepSeek R1’s model allows AI companies to achieve dramatic reductions in both the time and cost associated with training large-scale AI models. DeepSeek Technologies reports that DeepSeek R1 has reduced model training costs by 50% compared to leading AI models, cutting down energy consumption by nearly the same margin. The cost-effectiveness comes from a combination of lower computational demands and a more streamlined training process, which significantly reduces the overall carbon footprint associated with AI model deployment.

For instance, training a model similar to GPT-3, which cost millions of dollars, now becomes feasible for companies with modest resources. This opens up new market opportunities for startups and small enterprises that previously could not afford such advanced AI technologies.

2.3 Open-Source Accessibility

DeepSeek R1 is released as an open-source model, allowing businesses and researchers to access and modify the underlying architecture at no cost. This has the potential to democratize access to advanced AI models, particularly in sectors where proprietary models like OpenAI’s GPT are too expensive.

By removing licensing fees and providing the codebase freely, DeepSeek R1 significantly reduces entry barriers for AI adoption. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), startups, and developers can leverage this model without requiring costly infrastructure or licensing agreements with the likes of Microsoft, Google, or Nvidia.

2.4 AI Scalability Across Devices

DeepSeek R1 is also designed for scalability, making it suitable for a wide variety of computing environments. While traditional large-scale AI models require massive data centers to operate, DeepSeek R1 can run efficiently on smaller, less expensive machines. This scalability extends not only to enterprise data centers but also to smaller devices, such as edge devices and IoT systems, further broadening the potential applications of AI.

This flexibility means that DeepSeek R1’s impact isn’t confined to large tech giants—it has the potential to reach into smaller markets and emerging economies, allowing for more widespread AI adoption in sectors like healthcare, education, logistics, and finance.

3. Competitive Impact: Threats and Opportunities for Leading AI Players

The arrival of DeepSeek R1 presents both threats and opportunities for established players in the AI space. Companies like Nvidia, Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI, who have invested heavily in AI infrastructure and proprietary models, face new competitive pressures. Understanding how these companies might respond to DeepSeek R1 is crucial for investors to assess the long-term implications for U.S. equities.

3.1 Nvidia: The Threat of Reduced GPU Demand

Nvidia has long been the dominant player in the AI hardware market, with its GPUs powering the training of most modern AI models. However, DeepSeek R1’s efficiency threatens to reduce demand for Nvidia’s high-end GPUs, which have become the go-to solution for AI model training.

DeepSeek’s more efficient algorithm means that companies can train AI models using fewer resources, which could reduce reliance on expensive GPUs. For example, a company like OpenAI, which traditionally used Nvidia’s A100 GPUs to train models like GPT-3, could shift to more efficient systems, reducing the number of Nvidia chips required for training.

While Nvidia still dominates the GPU market for gaming and other applications, its heavy reliance on the AI sector could see a decline in growth if AI model training costs continue to decrease. This could impact Nvidia’s stock price, particularly if the demand for its products drops in favor of more cost-efficient solutions like DeepSeek R1.

3.2 Google and Microsoft: Adapting to the Open-Source Model

Google and Microsoft, two of the largest cloud providers, have invested heavily in AI and cloud infrastructure. Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure both offer AI services powered by proprietary models, such as Google’s PaLM and OpenAI’s GPT, integrated into their respective platforms.

DeepSeek R1’s open-source nature threatens to disrupt this business model. If more companies and developers choose to use DeepSeek’s AI solutions for free or at a low cost, they may forgo using expensive cloud services like Google Cloud or Microsoft Azure. This could hurt the profitability of these cloud giants, which rely on recurring subscription fees and usage charges for their AI offerings.

In response, Google and Microsoft may look to integrate DeepSeek R1 into their cloud offerings or find ways to optimize their own AI systems to match the cost-effectiveness of DeepSeek. Another potential avenue is providing value-added services on top of DeepSeek R1, such as specialized AI models or enterprise solutions, allowing these companies to maintain revenue streams despite the reduced demand for raw compute power.

3.3 OpenAI: Navigating the Competitive Waters of Open-Source AI

OpenAI, known for its GPT-3 and GPT-4 models, has dominated the AI space in recent years. However, as an organization that relies heavily on proprietary models, OpenAI may find itself at a crossroads with the rise of open-source alternatives like DeepSeek R1.

The core question for OpenAI is whether it can continue to justify its pricing model for GPT models when developers have access to a free alternative. OpenAI may look to pivot by focusing on offering customized solutions or proprietary applications, while continuing to benefit from its established brand and ecosystem. However, the growing open-source movement could erode OpenAI’s market share over time if DeepSeek R1 and similar models gain traction.

4. Broader Market Implications: U.S. Equities and Global Trends

The advent of DeepSeek R1 has significant implications for the broader market, particularly in terms of equity valuation, investment trends, and technological advancement. The following section will explore these market impacts in detail.

The reduction in AI model training costs could have wide-ranging implications for the profitability of companies that depend on AI. In particular, businesses in sectors like cloud computing, AI software, and hardware could be significantly impacted.

The entry of DeepSeek R1 into the AI ecosystem could also shift investor attention to AI startups and small-to-medium enterprises that are capable of leveraging the model’s open-source nature to create specialized solutions. This would create a more fragmented but dynamic market, with greater opportunities for high-growth firms that can innovate quickly.

4.2 Macroeconomic Impact: AI for Global Development

Beyond U.S. equities, DeepSeek R1 has the potential to drive macroeconomic shifts globally. By lowering the cost of AI model training, businesses and governments in emerging economies can now implement AI solutions in industries like healthcare, agriculture, and transportation.

This democratization of AI technology has the potential to lift entire economies, particularly in regions where access to advanced technology has historically been limited. The broader global adoption of AI will foster economic growth, boost productivity, and improve efficiency across multiple sectors.

4.3 Ethical and Regulatory Considerations

As AI technology becomes more pervasive, the ethical and regulatory landscape will also need to evolve. Open-source models like DeepSeek R1 raise questions about data privacy, security, and the potential for misuse. Regulators will need to establish frameworks to ensure that AI models are developed and deployed in a manner that benefits society while minimizing harm.

Given the speed at which AI is developing, policymakers will face challenges in keeping up with technological advancements. Ensuring transparency, accountability, and fairness in AI deployment will be critical as the industry grows.

5. Conclusion: Navigating the Future of AI and U.S. Equities

The introduction of DeepSeek R1 is a pivotal moment in the AI space, as it introduces a more cost-effective, scalable, and accessible alternative to traditional AI models. The potential implications for U.S. equities, particularly in the tech sector, are profound. Nvidia, Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI must now navigate an increasingly competitive landscape where cost-effectiveness, scalability, and open-source accessibility are paramount.

Investors should closely monitor the evolution of DeepSeek R1 and similar AI models, as these innovations are likely to disrupt established business models and redefine competitive dynamics in the tech sector. The future of AI is undoubtedly bright, but the path forward will require companies to adapt quickly to emerging trends in efficiency, accessibility, and regulation.

By staying ahead of these shifts, both companies and investors can position themselves to capitalize on the growing AI-driven revolution.","['NVDA', 'NVDA', 'MSFT', 'NVDA', 'MSFT', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'MSFT', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'MSFT', 'MSFT', 'MSFT', 'MSFT', 'MSFT', 'NVDA', 'MSFT']",0,36,21,2025-01-28 03:10:23+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ibs3vi/comprehensive_analysis_of_deepseek_r1_and_its/,0.9997
Stocks,"Trump To Tariff Chips Made In Taiwan, Targeting TSMC","President Trump plans to impose tariffs of up to 100% on chips produced in Taiwan, targeting companies like TSMC, which supplies Apple, Nvidia, and AMD. The tariffs aim to encourage more chip production in the US, with Trump criticizing the CHIPS and Science Act for providing funds to companies that already have significant resources. The policy may cause price hikes for various computer products, as it takes years to build chip factories. TSMC-made chips are typically not exported directly to the US, but rather sent to other countries for assembly into consumer electronics. The implementation of such tariffs will depend on US trade officials.

Stocks,"Nvidia sheds almost $600 billion in market cap, biggest one-day loss in U.S. history","Nvidia lost close to $600 billion in market cap on Monday, the biggest drop for any company on a single day in U.S. history.

The chipmaker’s stock price plummeted 17% to close at $118.58. It was Nvidia’s worst day on the market since March 16, 2020, which was early in the Covid pandemic. After surpassing Apple last week to become the most valuable publicly traded company, Nvidia’s drop on Monday led a 3.1% slide in the tech-heavy Nasdaq.

The selloff was sparked by concerns that Chinese artificial intelligence lab DeepSeek is presenting increased competition in the global AI battle. Late last month, DeepSeek unveiled a free, open-source large language model that it says took only two months and less than $6 million to build, using reduced-capability chips from Nvidia, called H800s. 

Nvidia’s graphics processing units (GPUs) dominate the market for AI data center chips in the U.S., with tech giants like Alphabet, Meta, and Amazon spending billions of dollars on the processors to train and run their AI models. Analysts at Cantor wrote in a report on Monday that the release of DeepSeek’s latest technology has caused “great angst as to the impact for compute demand, and therefore, fears of peak spending on GPUs.”

The analysts, who recommend buying Nvidia shares, said they “think this view is farthest from the truth,” and that advancements in AI will most likely lead to “the AI industry wanting more compute, not less.”

But after Nvidia’s huge run-up — the stock soared 239% in 2023 and 171% last year — the market is on edge about any possible pullback in spending. Broadcom, the other big U.S. chipmaker to see giant valuation gains from AI, fell 17% on Monday, pulling its market cap down by $200 billion.

Data center companies reliant on Nvidia’s GPUs for their hardware sales saw big selloffs as well. Dell, Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Super Micro Computer dropped at least 5.8%. Oracle, a part of President Donald Trump’s latest AI initiative, fell 14%.

For Nvidia, the loss was more than double the $279 billion drop the company saw in September, which was the biggest one-day market value loss in history at the time, unseating Meta’s $232 billion loss in 2022. Before that, the steepest drop was $182 billion by Apple in 2020.

Nvidia’s decline is more than double the market cap of Coca-Cola and Chevron and exceeds the market value of both Oracle and Netflix.

CEO Jensen Huang’s net worth also took a massive hit, declining roughly $21 billion, according to Forbes’ real-time billionaires list. The move demoted Huang to 17th on the richest-person list.

The sudden excitement around DeepSeek over the weekend pushed its app past OpenAI’s ChatGPT as the most-downloaded free app in the U.S. on Apple’s App Store. The model’s development comes despite a slew of recent curbs on U.S. chip exports to China.

Venture capitalist David Sacks, who was tapped by Trump to be the White House’s AI and crypto czar, wrote on X that DeepSeek’s model “shows that the AI race will be very competitive” and that Trump was right to rescind President Joe Biden’s executive order last week on AI safety.

“I’m confident in the U.S. but we can’t be complacent,” Sacks wrote.

Nvidia is now the third most-valuable public company, behind Apple and Microsoft.

Stocks,70% of AI workloads will shift to real-time inference by 2030 (McKinsey) - What stocks benefit?,"This was published 3 days ago so not sure if it was coincidence or triggered by the Deepseek panic. But it's certainly timely:

>While training current advanced AI models requires immense computing resources, the shift towards real-time decision-making - known as inferencing - is poised to drive massive demand for additional computing power. According to McKinsey, 60-70% of AI workloads are expected to shift to real-time inference by 2030, creating an urgent need for low-latency connectivity, compute and security at the edge beyond current demand.

Note that this is a [Verizon press release](https://www.verizon.com/about/news/verizon-unveils-ai-strategy-power-next-gen-ai-demands), so take it with a grain of salt. (I tried looking for the original McKinsey article but didn't find it).

Assuming this projection is true, what stocks will benefit? 

* Telecom? AT&T went up big today?
* Apple and other mobile related stocks?
* Edge computing and cybersecurity?

I asked Perplexity and this was the result:

* NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): NVIDIA is a leading player in edge computing and AI-optimized processors15. Its EGX Edge Computing Platform offers a comprehensive solution combining hardware and software for various edge computing applications1.

* Arista Networks (ANET): Arista has developed a growing business providing network equipment for small, on-site data centers and infrastructure software for managing local networks enabled by edge computing2.

* Nutanix (NTNX): Nutanix offers hardware for cloud and edge computing, with its hyper-converged technology ensuring high performance and agility for edge computing users2.

* Ambarella (AMBA): Ranked as a top edge AI stock for 2025, Ambarella focuses on developing specialized hardware for edge computing applications3.

* Cloudflare (NET): Strategically positioned at the intersection of AI, cybersecurity, and edge computing, Cloudflare is well-placed to benefit from these trends5.

Stocks,The Case for TSLA: the Business Value,"Many people consider TSLA to be overvalued based on fundamentals. Make no mistake - it absolutely is... based on fundamentals.

The value of TSLA, beyond the Twitter-political volatility, comes from its proven track record in achieving the impossible.

**Breaking Into an Otherwise Unbreakable Car Market**

How many new Western car companies can you recall successfully breaking into the market in the last few decades?

The only real answer is TSLA.

Everything else is bleeding money, a penny stock, or a YouTube car review channel side quest.

**Popularizing an Otherwise Undesirable and Impossible Product**

Before the EV boom, any consideration of a successful EV business would be immediately countered with legitimate concerns.

The car community wouldn't be very excited without their loud 4L V8 engines.

The product would be impossible to make as the batteries would be expensive, heavy, unreliable, and yield a low driving range. If you did get an EV, you wouldn't be able to charge it since there were no charger networks.

Not to mention the expected environmental returns from selling EVs, but generally disrupting the market and directing it towards sustainable energy cars. I love my fuel-hungry loud 6-cylinder German beast, but ICE engines in the mainstream have an expiration date and will eventually become a niche when the larger market transitions to EVs. TSLA takes the credit for this - singlehandedly. Everybody else follows.

**Scaling Up: Actually Selling Cars**

Tesla is [still leading](https://www.automotivedive.com/news/electric-vehicle-sales-us-2024-increase-cox-automotive/737528/) EV sales, and is in the [top 10](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/06/top-10-best-selling-cars-in-the-us-in-2023.html) of all car sales. Meanwhile, VW is closing down their factories in Germany.

**Advertisement by Word of Mouth**

You see Ford Focus 1.0 EcoBoost billboard ads everywhere in Europe, and RAM / JEEP / Chevy Silverado / F-150 / Hyundai / Kia ads everywhere in the US.

TSLA built itself on word of mouth and a vision for the future, which is a testament to its value for customers.

**Elon's Proven Track Record in Business**

[Winning](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/16/science/spacex-moon-nasa.html) NASA award contracts in competition with Blue Origin and other space companies, [catching](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp66ye6ep63o) skyscraper sized objects landing, and a Roadster [roaming](https://www.astronomy.com/science/astronomers-just-deleted-an-asteroid-because-it-turned-out-to-be-elon-musks-tesla-roadster/) through space are just a few of the business and technological achievements of Elon Musk (not to mention the side quests). With someone so unreasonably effective at building things that work, investors project that TSLA is a safe and promising bet.

How many reusable rockets has anybody else caught landing recently?

**Criticisms**

No product or company is without criticisms. From the bad build quality, to the still-unfulfilled FSD promises, to the lack of Cybertrucks in Europe, to the removal of the turn signal stalks; and most recently, the political criticisms.

**Consequential Actions, Not Ideologies, Drive the World**

The bottom line for a business is creating products and services that people love, and there are *zero* indicators that TSLA, as a business, is going anywhere. It thrives *despite* all criticism (of which I do think most is reasonable) and lack of marketing, which is a testament to the value they provide.

**Market Temper Tantrums Are a Feature, Not a Bug**

Look beyond the ephemeral temper tantrum-driven volatility of the market.

Last year, in March, GOOG dipped from 160 to 135 when Gemini generated some questionable images; today it's close to ATH at >200.

Last year, in August, CRWD dipped from 380 to 220 when they pushed out a buggy update. (How dare they, a software company, pushing a buggy update?!) Today, it's trading close to ATH again.

Today, the market finally noticed DeepSeek and is going through yet another mental breakdown.

It is like a palm tree: it will bend but it won't break.

Learn to put your prejudices aside and buy companies that execute well - not companies with a nice little PR team that will sweet talk you.

**But Is It Overpriced?**

By traditional fundamentals analysis - of course it is. But we've already established there's nothing traditional about TSLA as a company, so your little P/E ratio calculations won't work. They have failed consistently.

Look at the execution of TSLA and compare it to its Western competitors - they aren't even in the same league.","['TWTR', 'TSLA', 'HYMTF']",0,10,7,2025-01-27 12:06:13+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ib78ft/the_case_for_tsla_the_business_value/,0.9485
Stocks,Are you panic selling NVDA because of DeepSeek?,"How do you think this was trained? Using their proprietary chipset? Haha

If anything, US companies will double down on training a better model. A lot of smaller companies can now enter the market due to low cost / low barrier to entry. And how do you think those model will be trained?

They are all using Nvidia chipset. If you didn’t know, now you know!

Sell all you can, because people who know will buy low so they can sell even higher.

Update: Found this article that says total REAL cost to train DeepSeek was in the region of 500M when taking into account other costs. This is far higher than what they claimed (6M) but still lot cheapr than OpenAI's $7b budget.

Stocks,"Will some Mag7, financial, and software stocks actually benefit from Deepseek?","If Deepseek's low training cost is not fake, who are the winners? Love to get everyone's take in case there's a big fire sale this week.

**Mag 7 Winners**

* Apple: This is where their lag in AI investment actually helps them. Now they can build better AI for their mobile devices, computers, home services, and their version of Omniverse at a much lower cost. 

* Google, which invested in their own cheaper chips instead of the Nvidia chips. Also has the most integrated AI stack which means they have more ability to adapt. 
* Amazon, same as Google but to a lesser degree.

**Financial**

* Cheaper model training cost means a lot more startups will gain meaningful access to AI, creating a lot more exciting use cases. More startup success means more M&A.

**Software**

* Cheaper model training cost also means the cost of companies running AI agents/software will also pay a lot less. They can pass on savings to customers, invest even more into R&D, and accelerate their agentic AI.

* Some picks off top of my head: Salesforce, cyber security stocks like PANW or Crowdstrike, Palantir, or just $IGV. 

**Healthcare / Drug Development**

* There should be less demand for Nvidia chips, making it cheaper for these industries to gain more (and cheaper) access to GPU.

Stocks,"AI
DeepSeek Shakes Up Stocks as Traders Fear for US Tech Leadership",">Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek rocked global technology stocks Monday, raising questions over America’s technological dominance.

>Buzz grew over the weekend about DeepSeek’s latest AI model being cost-effective while running on reduced-capability chips, casting doubt on the validity of the sky-high valuations for companies like Nvidia Corp. The Chinese firm’s product, released last week, is now at the top of Apple Inc.’s App Store rankings.

>“DeepSeek shows that it is possible to develop powerful AI models that cost less,” said Vey-Sern Ling, managing director at Union Bancaire Privee. “It can potentially derail the investment case for the entire AI supply chain, which is driven by high spending from a small handful of hyperscalers.”

>Founded by quant fund founder Liang Wenfeng, the app’s underlying AI model is widely seen as competitive with OpenAI and Meta Platforms Inc.’s latest. Lauded by investor Marc Andreessen as “one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs,” DeepSeek’s assistant shows its work and reasoning as it addresses a user’s written query or prompt. Reviews on Apple’s app store and on Alphabet Inc.’s Android Play Store praised that transparency.

>Nasdaq 100 futures tumbled as much as 1.9%, while contracts on the S&P 500 fell as much as 1%. The moves represent continued losses from Friday’s cash session, as US shares cooled after gains earlier in the week as President Donald Trump took office.

>In contrast, stocks advanced in Hong Kong, with the Hang Seng Tech Index climbing as much as 2% ahead of Lunar New Year holidays this week. Chinese AI-related stocks including Merit Interactive Co. surged by their daily limits. Merit is among those with the clearest links to DeepSeek after stating in an earlier filing that it had incorporated the homegrown AI firm’s model into marketing.

>Meanwhile, shares in the AI supply chain slumped as investors rethink their assumptions that the most advanced AI will require increasing amounts of computing power and energy. Major Nvidia supplier Advantest Corp., slid as much as 8.6% in Tokyo. Data centers shares also slipped, with Singapore-listed Mapletree Industrial Trust down 3.6%. Markets were closed for holidays in Taiwan and South Korea.

>The DeepSeek product “is deeply problematic for the thesis that the significant capital expenditure and operating expenses that Silicon Valley has incurred is the most appropriate way to approach the AI trend,’ said Nirgunan Tiruchelvam, head of consumer and internet at Singapore-based Aletheia Capital. “It calls into question the massive resources that have been dedicated to AI.”

>Kyle Rodda, senior market analyst at Capital.com, says the updated AI model unveiled by China’s DeepSeek raises concerns about geopolitical risks as well as questions about US tech stock valuations.

>The decline in Nasdaq futures comes at the start of a big week for earnings from major tech companies including Apple and Microsoft Corp. Profit growth is expected to have slowed while valuations remain inflated, once again causing concern over the large AI-driven rally in the sector.

>The Nasdaq 100 is trading at 27 estimated forward earnings, compared with its three-year average of 24 times. Nvidia is at 33 times, though that’s slightly down from its three-year average. Shares of Nvidia were more than 3% lower on the alternative trading system Blue Ocean in Asia morning, according to Kok Hoong Wong, head of institutional equities sales trading at Maybank Securities

>The DeepSeek release raises new doubts, challenging the notion that China’s AI technology is years behind US counterparts. Washington’s trade restrictions had kept the most cutting-edge chips out of China’s hands, but DeepSeek’s model was built using open source technology that is easy to access.

>“While current leaders like Nvidia have a strong foothold, it is a reminder that AI dominance cannot be taken for granted,” said Charu Chanana, chief investment strategist at Saxo Markets. “The emergence of China’s DeepSeek indicates that competition is intensifying, and although it may not pose a significant threat now, future competitors will evolve faster and challenge the established companies more quickly. Earnings this week will be a huge test.”

Stocks,S&P500 vs individual stocks,"Hi all,
Apologies for the maybe stupid question.

I have started investing about 1 year ago almost all of it (if not all) into well diversified ETFs like SXR8 and SPYY (yes, I know they overlap but I wanted to make it a little bit more USA heavy).

Now, I have really been wanting to invest into stocks and, of course, do the due diligence of learning about it. As I am still on the basics I can't help myself but ask, even long term, is SPY a better bet than, let's say, AAPL?
I understand that sometimes picking the ""good"" stock is difficult, but even 10 years ago Apple was among the companies with the highest market cap and still managed to outperform the index.

So I have 2 stupid questions based on this:
1. In your opinion, might this continue to happen in the future? Not necessarily apple but alphabet, Microsoft, nvidia or Meta are safer bets than Spy?
2. What are your recommendations on where to learn about investing into individual stocks, not say trading but more middle term (I believe it's called swing trading?)

Stocks,"Apple Remains a Threat in AR, Even as Meta and Google Race Ahead",">Meta and Google have jumped out ahead in the race to make augmented reality glasses for consumers, but Apple remains a looming threat. Also: The iPhone maker brings in a fixer for its Siri and AI efforts, and the company has a decision to make about its longtime chairman. Samsung, meanwhile, just unveiled impressive new AI features and is poised to beat Apple to market with a skinny smartphone.

>A decade ago, it began developing AR technology for its now-defunct attempt to build a self-driving vehicle. The idea: a windshield that could overlay navigation information, traffic alerts, camera feeds and other data while the car drove around town on its own. Apple even built a simulator of the concept at its Silicon Valley offices and managed to turn the idea into a working prototype that showed promise to executives.

>But the company quickly realized that this Minority Report-like experience would be too power-hungry and expensive to put inside of a vehicle. So it turned its attention to headsets, which can provide the same data in a smaller package. A person in the car could simply wear some headgear instead of needing to have the technology built into the windshield.

>The car glasses idea didn’t get too far either. But Apple’s vehicle group poured resources into developing AR displays and used virtual reality goggles to demonstrate the car’s capabilities. That ultimately led to Apple’s work on a consumer headset.

>At the time, Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook felt that VR goggles were too isolating. He preferred AR, which keeps users in the real world while superimposing data on their field of vision. But it was also clear that the true AR dream — a lightweight pair of glasses that customers could wear all day — was still far off.

>That’s about the time when Mike Rockwell stepped in. That executive, who currently oversees Apple’s Vision Pro division, moved the AR and VR efforts into a team that was separate from the car unit. Rockwell and his staff spent the better part of two years creating a headset prototype that melded VR and AR into an approach that Apple eventually called spatial computing.

>This was the great compromise: Users weren’t truly seeing the real world around them, but the device’s pass-through cameras made it feel like they were. The project was greenlit, and the company eventually spent billions of dollars to develop the device — all while continuing to work on making true AR glasses a reality. That led to the release of the Vision Pro mixed-reality headset a year ago.

>Apple had originally hoped to release AR spectacles as a follow-up to the Vision Pro, but the technical challenges were just too great. Such a product remains far away, and the company is still tinkering with the underlying technologies.

>At the same time, rivals like Meta Platforms Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google have jumped ahead in the AR race. Meta showed off a prototype of augmented reality glasses last year, and Google is working with Samsung Electronics Co. on their own next-generation devices. Meta also has had success with its Ray-Ban smart glasses, which don’t have a display but can handle tasks like recording video and making phone calls.

>The Vision Pro, meanwhile, has largely been a flop, hurt by its cumbersome design and $3,500 price tag. That said, it’s hard to discount Apple’s innovation abilities. Work on the AR screens remains ongoing at a secretive facility in Santa Clara, California, one town over from the company’s home base in Cupertino.

>Though there were layoffs at the site last year — when Apple scrapped plans for in-house smartwatch displays — the company kept some employees around to work on AR technology, along with a manufacturing facility to develop and test future screens.

>Tepid demand for the Vision Pro has only made Apple more certain that AR glasses are a superior format. But the executives involved in the effort don’t think a product will be ready for three years or more. In the meantime, Apple expects to release other devices in the style of Vision Pro that it hopes will be cheaper and more enticing to consumers.

>While it develops the AR technology for future devices, the company is conducting user studies at its offices to gauge the appeal of features and interfaces. Apple is already working on a version of visionOS — the Vision Pro’s software — that will run on glasses. It’s also exploring other types of wearable products, including a rival to Meta’s Ray-Ban spectacles and even camera-equipped AirPods.

>The question now is whether Apple’s rivals are getting too far ahead. Meta’s AR prototype, called Orion, will set the stage for a consumer product by 2027. And Google’s new Android XR operating system is meant to usher in a wave of headsets and glasses, with Samsung first in line to release devices.

>When I first tested Android XR in December at Google’s headquarters, the company showed me several glasses prototypes — with and without displays. They seemed polished for prototypes, but they won’t hit the market until the display technology improves and costs come down. Another issue to be solved: battery life.

>Meta, Google and Samsung also aren’t slowing down on development of VR and mixed-reality devices. Meta is working on Quest 4 VR goggles, as well as a new high-end model that could eventually become a successor to the Quest Pro mixed-reality headset, I’m told. Samsung, meanwhile, showed off the hardware for its “Moohan” mixed-reality headset during its Unpacked event this past week.

>In interviews, Samsung and Google executives hinted that this headset would be cheaper than the Vision Pro and that it’s on track to debut this year. The companies won’t have to share the spotlight with Apple, which is unlikely to ship any major new head-worn device in 2025.

>But the real showdown will come in the years ahead, when AR glasses are refined enough to serve as a smartphone replacement. You can imagine a future where people use smart spectacles as their primary mobile device and then turn to a mixed-reality or VR headset for gaming or computing tasks. In that vision, head-worn devices will have supplanted both phones and laptops — markets worth hundreds of billions of dollars.

>Given what’s at stake, Apple can’t afford to stay on the sidelines too long. But the company does have a history of swooping into already-established markets and beating competitors with better design and more elegantly integrated hardware and software. The playbook it used so effectively in smartphones and watches could work again.

Stocks,Intel Will Keep Failing But Eventually Succeed,"It is mentioned many times that Intel is the only foundry capable of developing chips used for AI, and the U.S. prioritizes heavily on safeguarding that industry because they don't want to become over-reliant on Taiwan. They want to have their own chip maker in case Taiwan is invaded. 

The U.S. government is desperately providing them billions of dollars of tax payer money trying to keep their business afloat, and to regain their competitive edge, but their efforts seems to be in vain as Intel keeps mismanaging their business. 

President Trump will impose tariffs on Taiwanese chips which hopefully causes more domestic companies to purchase from Intel and improving their balance sheet. Hopefully the deep-state who are major shareholders of some of these biggest companies will flex their muscles and order these companies to buy from Intel whenever possible. 

Despite these funds from the U.S. government and Trump's protectionist tariff policies, I doubt Intel will make a comeback within the next 2 to 3 years. I believe their stock will continue to decline to $19, $18 and all the way down to $15. 

It sucks being an intel bag holder, but I have great faith in the deep-state's central planning. It has brought to their attention that it is of utmost importance to have a world-leading chip foundry. If the deep-state wants to Intel to have a leading chip-foundry, they will make sure it will succeed no matter what.

Stocks,"White House in talks to have Oracle, US investors take over TikTok, NPR reports",">The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump is working on a plan to save TikTok that involves tapping software company Oracle and a group of outside investors to effectively take control of the app's global operations, National Public Radio reported on Saturday.

>

>Under the deal being negotiated by the White House, TikTok's China-based owner, ByteDance, would retain a minority stake in the company, but the app's algorithm, data collection and software updates would be overseen by Oracle, which already provides the foundation of TikTok's Web infrastructure, NPR reported.

>

>The NPR report cited two people with knowledge of the talks. The White House and Oracle had no immediate comment.

>

>The short video app used by 170 million Americans was taken offline temporarily for users shortly before a law that said it must be sold by its Chinese owner ByteDance on national security grounds, or be banned, took effect on Jan. 19.

>

>Trump, after taking office a day later, signed an executive order seeking to delay by 75 days the enforcement of the law that was put in place after U.S. officials warned that under ByteDance, there was a risk of Americans' data being misused.

>

>The possible deal reported by NPR would mean that American investors would own a majority stake in TikTok. However, the report added that the terms of the deal could change and are still being hammered out.

>

>""The goal is for Oracle to effectively monitor and provide oversight with what is going on with TikTok,"" a person directly involved in the talks but not authorized to speak publicly was quoted as saying by NPR.

>

>""ByteDance wouldn't completely go away, but it would minimize Chinese ownership.""

>

>Other potential investors who are engaged in the talks include Microsoft, NPR reported.

>

>Officials from Oracle and the White House held a meeting on Friday about a potential deal, and another meeting has been scheduled for next week, NPR reported.

>

>Oracle was interested in a TikTok stake ""in the tens of billions,"" but the rest of the deal is in flux, the NPR report cited the source as saying.

>

>Trump has said he ""would like the United States to have a 50% ownership position in a joint venture"" in TikTok.

>

>NPR cited another source as saying that appeasing Congress is seen as a key hurdle by the White House.

>

>Free speech advocates have opposed TikTok's ban under a law passed by the U.S. Congress and signed by former President Joe Biden.

>

>The company says U.S. officials misstated its ties to China, arguing its content recommendation engine and user data are stored in the United States on cloud servers operated by Oracle while content moderation decisions that affect American users are also made in the U.S.

**Thoughts:** There are a TON of entities/people who have been rumored to buy Tik Tok (off the top of my head I can list Elon Musk, META, Kevin O' Leary, Mr. Beast and an assortment of random PE firms, Perplexity AI, and now Larry Ellison/ORCL)- I assume that these entities and affiliated companies may be worth looking at and possibly taking a short position in if they've reacted strongly to Tiktok acquisition rumors in the past.

Stocks,Deere - has run out of room to run.,"The great American company is trading at a all time high but is facing a lot of headwinds in 2025.

1 Tarriffs - Deere made the mistake of outsourcing their production outside the US and will pay the price with the new administration. They recently announced they were moving production to Mexico for some of the equipment manufacturing which lead to a boycott by farmers and a threat of 200% tariff if they do, which wont happen because you cant really impose this (tariff)tax on a specific company. But this was a mistake by the company because now they spent all this money to setup the factories and production in Mexico but cant really use it as intended.

[https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-says-john-deere-will-be-hit-with-200-tariffs-if-production-moves-mexico-2024-09-23/](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-says-john-deere-will-be-hit-with-200-tariffs-if-production-moves-mexico-2024-09-23/)

They also made the mistake of outsourcing tractor production to India. A good amount of production is outside the US, meaning tractors are assembled in India, Europe and elsewhere and sent to the US for sale. Which is a problem because these are not cheap tractors/equipment and someone is going to pay the tariff on foreign goods entering the United States. Not that easy to readjust the whole supply chain back to the US and having to pay people alot more money. Average worker in India makes $5k per year ,in the US these manufacturing jobs will cost maybe $50k-$80k+ per year. Profit margins just got smaller.

Then there is the US manufacturing exports. Deere Exports alot of their products to other countries, not all customers are in the US. If we impose tariffs on lets say German cars coming into the US, they will 100% in retaliation impose tariffs on US cars, heavy equipment and farm equipment being sent into Europe, South America, China, Etc.  Deere isnt the only manufacturer of tractors and farm equipment, you have a lot of manufacturers around the world. People are just going to buy cheaper domestic products.

2 Rumored Pick up truck - There's been a rumor going around they are planning to launch a pick up truck. I think this would be a costly mistake and they just wouldn't be able to compete with the best selling pickup in the world the F-150. Car manufacturing is very expensive as Elon has stressed multiple times, ramping up production costs ALOT of money, and might not be worth the effort, especially if it flops. There is just too much competition is the space between Toyota, Ford, General Motors, Tesla, Rivian, Nissan, Dodge.

3 FTC sues Deere for Farmers right to repair - The complaint -This unfair steering practice has boosted Deere’s multi-billion-dollar profits on agricultural equipment and parts, growing its repair parts business while burdening farmers with higher repair costs, the FTC’s complaint alleges.

i dont think this FTC suit is going away, the current administration will 100% stand behind the hard working farmers that feed America. 62% of revenue comes from Agriculture Equipment and 13% comes from financial services. Farmers are using Deere Financing to repair Deere equipment, Its 100% a monopoly.

I know Amazon reinvests earnings so this probably plays a part but how much?

Amazon also has highest revenue of any of its peers, and margins on e-commerce are skeletal and 60% of net income comes from AWS.

Is this high P/E a problem or not? I suspect given Amazon had $574 billion in revenue in 2023 there's only so many years the company can continue growing at 10% a year. I cannot even picture a company with annual revenue of $1 trillion and numerically Amazon is less than a decade away from that at 10% growth rates.

Stocks,TSM vs Nvidia,"Obviously, Trump announcing he'll invest $500 billion into AI is a big boom for Nvidia. But how will Trump's tariffs impact Nvidia's future sells? 

That got my thinking - what company would benefit from Trump's announcement while being immune from his tariffs? The conclusion I came to is TSMC (TSM).

Nvidia, and pretty all tech companies in the world, contracts TSMC (TSM) to make their semiconductors and chips for them. If Nvidia sales improve, TSMC's sales will improve. And because TSMC is a Taiwanese company, they're not going to be impacted by Trump's tariffs...unless Trump decides to put tariffs on Taiwan which seems unlikely.

What does everyone think? Is TSM a better investment than Nvidia?","['NVDA', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'NVDA']",0,27,17,2025-01-24 12:58:53+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1i8usl1/tsm_vs_nvidia/,0.9767

Stocks,Switched from Ameriprise managed account to Fidelity - Sell individual stocks?,"After a year of trying an Ameriprise managed account, I recently moved everything to Fidelity to start managing it myself. They underperformed the S&P500 (before their fee), and almost all positions are just S&P500 companies anyways, so I figured if I went 100% into an S&P index on my own I can't do worse.

I'm not sure how best to proceed with the current number of individual stocks. There are 64 positions total and it's unrealistic that I'll be able to keep track of the performance/trajectory of that many companies. Buffet's ""pick a few winners"" comes to mind. I've been assuming the best thing to do is to slowly liquidate the one's I don't have a specific interest in, and buy VOO/SPY in their place.

There are many companies that I like and would like to hold on to (AAPL, AMD, AMZN, BRKB, GOOGL, JNJ, KO, MSFT, NVDA, NFLX, PG). However, the majority are S&P 500 companies that I don't follow closely (ABT, ADBE, AMAT, AMGN, AMT, AVGO, AZN, BA, BMY, CAT, COP, CRM, CVX, ... to name a few). It's not that I don't know those companies, but it feels ignorant to hold onto them knowing that I won't have time to monitor their performance.

Is there a best way to go about liquidating those and moving into an S&P 500 index?

Stocks,Apple and Google's massive mobile empires face dual UK antitrust probes,"Britain’s competition regulator on Thursday launched an investigation into Apple and Google’s huge mobile ecosystems to determine whether the tech titans are in breach of the U.K.’s strict new digital competition rules.

The U.K. Competition and Markets Authority said it was opening dual probes into both U.S. tech giants to assess whether they hold “strategic market status” in their respective mobile ecosystems, including operating systems, app stores and smartphone-based browsers.

The investigations will “explore the impact on people who use mobile devices and the thousands of businesses developing innovative services or content such as apps for these devices,” the CMA said.

“Apple believes in thriving and dynamic markets where innovation can flourish,” an Apple spokesperson told CNBC. “We face competition in every segment and jurisdiction where we operate, and our focus is always the trust of our users.”

“In the U.K. alone, the iOS app economy supports hundreds of thousands of jobs and makes it possible for developers big and small to reach users on a trusted platform,” the Apple spokesperson added. “We will continue to engage constructively with the CMA as their work on this matter progresses.”

Google was not immediately available for comment when contacted by CNBC.

New powers

The CMA now has enhanced regulatory powers after a new U.K. law, called the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act, or DMCC, came into effect at the start of this year.

The DMCC seeks to prevent anti-competitive behavior in digital markets. It can designate large companies that have a significant amount of market power in a certain digital activity as having “strategic market status.”

The CMA now has the power to impose changes to prevent potential anti-competitive behavior from any firm that is given strategic market status.

According to the regulator, virtually all mobile devices sold in the U.K. are pre-installed with either Apple’s iOS or Google’s Android operating systems, and their app stores and browsers have either exclusive or leading positions on their platforms compare to alternative products and services.

Almost all (94%) of people aged 16 or above — about 56 million consumers — in the U.K. currently have access to a smartphone and the average Brit spends around three hours a day using a mobile device, the CMA added.

The body said it would examine three key issues, including the extent of competition between Apple and Google’s mobile ecosystems, possible leveraging of the tech giants’ market power into other activities and potential exploitative conduct.

“More competitive mobile ecosystems could foster new innovations and new opportunities across a range of services that millions of people use, be they app stores, browsers or operating systems,” Sarah Cardell, chief executive of the CMA, said in a statement Thursday.

“Better competition could also boost growth here in the UK, with businesses able to offer new and innovative types of products and services on Apple’s and Google’s platforms,” Cardell added.

Stocks,Tesla Bullish Upgrade,"Wedbush analyst Dan Ives raised Tesla's price target to $550, citing a 'golden era' for Elon Musk under Trump's administration. Despite declining U.S. deliveries and potential policy changes, Ives remains optimistic, setting a bull case target of $650. The potential elimination of EV tax credits and debates around Tesla's Optimus robot program add uncertainty. Tesla's stock has gained 98.81% over the past year, with a consensus price target of $308.4.

Stocks,"EA shares drop 7% after company lowers guidance due to weakness in soccer, other games","Electronic Arts slashed its full-year bookings guidance on Wednesday, blaming the shortfall on underperforming games, notably its soccer franchise, EA Sports FC. The shares dropped 7% in extended trading.

For the fiscal third quarter, which ended Dec. 31, EA said it expects to report about $2.215 billion in net bookings, versus previous guidance of $2.4 billion to $2.55 billion.

Revenue in the December quarter will be about $1.88 billion, with $1.11 in diluted earnings per share, the company said in a statement.

EA said it expects net bookings for the full fiscal year, ending March 31, of between $7 billion and $7.15 billion, below previous guidance of $7.5 billion to $7.8 billion. EA says net bookings include physical game sales as well as revenue from online games.

The warning reveals weakness in the most prominent soccer video game franchise since 1993. It used to fall under the FIFA branding, but in 2022 EA’s deal with FIFA ended and the last two EA soccer games have been sold as EA Sports FC.

The company also said that “Dragon Age,” a role-playing game for game consoles such as Sony PlayStation and Microsoft Xbox, had 1.5 million players during the quarter, which underperformed the company’s expectations by nearly 50%.

“During Q3, we continued to deliver high-quality games and experiences across our portfolio,” EA CEO Andrew Wilson said in the statement. “However, Dragon Age and EA SPORTS FC 25 underperformed our net bookings expectations.”

EA said that while its soccer franchise, which it calls Global Football, had seen two years of double-digit growth in net booking, it started to see a slowdown during the December quarter. The company said that it expects Global Football sales to be down on a year-over-year basis, and said that bookings from online sales, or live services, would also decline in fiscal 2025. The company’s soccer franchise, accounted for the majority of the live services shortfall.

EA said that recently updated FC 25 with new content, improved gameplay, and an annual “Team of the Year” update, which it says was well-received by players.

The warning comes weeks ahead of EA’s planned third-quarter earnings on Feb. 4.

Stocks,What have the factors been behind Tesla's slowing revenue growth (aside from Musk's shenanigans)?,"In 2022 Tesla's year on year revenue growth was 51.35%. In 2023 it was 18.80%. By the quarter ending June 2024 this had shrivelled to 2.30%.

Growing competition from BYD and co

corresponding drop in market share (in 2021 Tesla held 75% now around 50%)

aging lineup (last new model was in 2020 apart from the Cybertruck)

Stocks,Nvidia Zero-Day Options Are the Next Big Bet for ETF Upstart,">The ETF industry’s upstart-in-chief is back with another roll of the new-product dice — this time betting on a game-changing expansion of Wall Street’s zero-day options boom.

>Matt Tuttle, who struck gold with leveraged meme-stock funds but fell flat with his Jim Cramer ETFs, has filed to create a line of new offerings that will trade fast-twitch derivatives on popular companies beloved by the retail-investing masses. Think Nvidia Corp., Tesla Inc., MicroStrategy Inc. and more.

>The gamble? Publicly traded single-stock options aren’t available on a daily basis, meaning 0DTE bets can currently only occur on a Friday when weekly, monthly and quarterly contracts expire. Yet Tuttle says he is convinced it’s a matter of time before derivatives tied to individual companies shift to daily expiry.

>“Whether that’s three months from now, six months from now, two years from now, I have no idea,” the Tuttle Capital Management CEO said. “My thinking is if I do believe that’s going to happen, I want to be first in line for it.”

>In the meantime, Tuttle has come up with a workaround for his new ETFs, which could launch in the first half of the year provided the Securities and Exchange Commission doesn’t object. They’ll trade so-called Flex options — customized contracts that allow users to set terms such as strike prices and expiration dates — and roll them on a daily basis. Such contracts can be listed on exchanges without approvals in advance, Tuttle said.

>America’s dynamic $11 trillion ETF industry is no stranger to investment strategies being prepared before demand, feasibility or even regulatory approval is assured. Increasingly complicated strategies featuring diverse leverage and return targets are being packaged into the easily traded wrapper and sold to the masses.

>Tuttle is seeking to capitalize on two hot but controversial trends on Wall Street: Selling options to generate income, and trading those with zero days to expiration, or 0DTE. His firm plans a series of so-called 0DTE covered-call ETFs targeting mostly technology megacaps including Apple Inc. and Microsoft Corp.

>To Ben Johnson, head of client solutions at Morningstar, the industry’s emphasis on first-mover advantage and apparent indifference to the risks of many strategies highlight the growing competition between firms for new business.

>“Another blast from the ETF industry’s spaghetti cannon, a shot fired in hopes that a few of these products might stick to the wall,” Johnson said. Sponsors are “clearly not all that interested in whether these products actually have any long-term investment merit,” he said.

[Data is normalized with percentage appreciation as of January 22, 2024.](https://preview.redd.it/42o9trirglee1.png?width=1003&format=png&auto=webp&s=70eb5246759f5b6b1167494bdd475b97e9b45bb3)

>The concept of an ETF using 0DTE options is not new. The likes of Defiance ETFs and Roundhill Investments have launched ETFs focused on indexes such as the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 that aim to harvest income from zero-day contracts. But almost three years after derivatives on indexes and ETFs began expiring daily, the same change has yet to be made for single-stock options.

>Unlike S&P 500 index options that are proprietary to Cboe Global Markets — the trading venue at the center of the 0DTE craze — listing single-stock zero-day contracts would be an industry-wide effort, said a spokesperson at the exchange.

>Tuttle attracted widespread attention in 2021 when he launched a fund betting against Cathie Wood’s Ark Innovation ETF. While his attempt to ride the fame of Cramer, the host of CNBC’s Mad Money show, sputtered in short order, his foray into super-leveraged single-stock ETFs produced some of 2024’s biggest hits.

>“The ETF industry is very clever about finding workarounds, to buy time until the real thing is ready,” Eric Balchunas, senior ETF analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence, said of the proposed funds. “In the end, how the sausage is made isn’t that important to investors. They just care that they’re getting this sort of cool hot sauce and end product.”

**Thoughts on this:** ETFs that become massive from investors not understanding the risks are nothing new (XIV, we shall never forget thee) but this will lead to interesting trading situations when there's dislocation between these theorized 0-DTE underlying ETFs and security itself. I can foresee a situation where 0-DTEs are massively overvalued/undervalued compared to what the underlying should theoretically be and then take a arbitrage position on these (assuming that the ETF is liquid). Guess they really want that options gambling money from the people who can't get approved to trade options.

> Shortly after President Donald Trump announced a new massive AI infrastructure investment from the White House, “First Buddy” Elon Musk tried to tear it down. “They don’t actually have the money,” Musk wrote on his social media platform X. “SoftBank has well under $10B secured. I have that on good authority.”

> Trump said the investment will create a new company, called Stargate, to grow artificial intelligence infrastructure in the United States. The leaders of SoftBank, OpenAI and Oracle stood alongside Trump during the announcement. Their respective companies will invest $100 billion in total for the project to start, with plans to pour up to $500 billion into Stargate in the coming years.

> Perhaps it should not be a surprise that Musk is going after an OpenAI initiative. Musk is in an ongoing lawsuit with OpenAI and its CEO Sam Altman, who was at the White House for the announcement. Musk, who has said he “doesn’t trust” Altman, claims in the lawsuit the ChatGPT has abandoned its original nonprofit mission by reserving some of its most advanced AI technology for private customers.

Stocks,"Trying to figure out where in the business stack to make my bed: New OpenAI Datacenters in Abilene, Texas","Hi everyone, this is my first post here, so I apologize if it's elementary.

I've invested long term in the defense sector companies and ETF's, and I'm looking to take a more proactive role in my trades with my new capital. I heard about this big joint Stargate deal and I wanted more information before I start building an investment portfolio.  
  
I read that the Data Centers are already being built in Abilene, Texas and started thinking of which part of this deal would be the best to invest in. There are the investors: MDX, Softbank, Blue Owl Capital, and Microsoft; The tech infrastructure players: Nvidia, OpenAI, Broadcom, TSMC, Oracle; And then the physical building & energy infrastructure that I'm most interested in.  
  
My thought process is: Regardless of whether or not the OpenAI deal follows through or not, builders and energy companies in the area will be getting a lot of money coming their way.  
I wasn't able to find any specific mentions of who is contracted to build out these Datacenters, who will be providing the electricity, nor whether they're publicly traded so I can invest. Any information about them, or how to find the ""back-end"" of these deals specifically, and which companies/ETF's may get boosted by proximity or direct involvement is really appreciated, thank you guys.

# Macro Overview:

**Electric Vehicle Growth**

The U.S. EV market is projected to show annual growth of 10.54% from 2025-2029, resulting in a market value of $156.3 billion by 2029 [according to Statista.](https://www.statista.com/outlook/mmo/electric-vehicles/united-states) Unit sales alone are projected to reach 2.32 million units by 2029 as well. Consumers now have significantly more choices when shopping for an electric vehicle. They can choose from offerings by [Tesla](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA/), [Ford](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/F/), [GM](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GM/), [Honda](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/HMC/), Hyundai, and many others.

EV's often have unique aesthetic and maintenance needs that typically have high-quality protective films and coatings. The growth in consumer adoption of EV's coincides with Xpel products, particularly on the impact in the aftermarket. EV owners value vehicle preservation. This creates a growing market share for XPEL'S products. These products also include heat-reducing window films that indirectly enhance battery performance.

**Aging Vehicles**

The average car or truck on the road in the U.S in 2024, was more than 12.6 years old, a new record according to [S&P Global](https://www.spglobal.com/mobility/en/research-analysis/fuel-for-thought-average-age-vehicles-2024.html#:~:text=Vehicles%20on%20the%20road%20are,by%20two%20months%20over%202023.). Consumers now choose to keep cars longer than they used to. This is largely because of the increases in new vehicle prices. As these older vehicles age, the demand for general maintenance and preservation are more-likely to rise.

Car price increases have climbed for four consecutive months, according to [Kelley Blue Book data](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/after-4-straight-months-price-increases-new-car-now-costs-nearly-50000). As of December 2024, the average price of a new vehicle was $49,740, the second-highest level ever recorded. Economic uncertainty and higher costs can discourage new purchases. This situation favors repairs and maintenance of existing vehicles as the fleet continues to get older before replacement.

**Technological advancements**

[Self-healing films](https://www.xpel.com/products/paint-protection-film/ultimate-plus?srsltid=AfmBOopjFd4lU0Io05gEI-r8EsK9Z7gIDE7DRjI1mI7yEhQAFqPDeofN) from XPEL and competitors [3M](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MMM/), [Eastman Performance Films](https://www.eastman.com/en/who-we-are/locations/fieldale-va-usa), and [STEK Automotive](https://www.stekautomotive.com/) were released much earlier. They have recently gained traction as consumers want paint protection film to protect their vehicles. Self-healing films use polymer capable of automatically repairing minor scratches and abrasions when exposed to heat. As vehicles on the road become increasingly older, the demand for reduced effort in maintaining a vehicle's exterior will increase. Vehicle owners will likely seek easier maintenance solutions with minimal effort that repel against water, dirt, and scratches more easily. Consumers and manufacturers are increasingly adopting self-healing films. People who want to protect their older vehicles find XPEL appealing. It is also chosen to keep luxury cars in pristine condition.

# Investment Thesis:

XPEL is a compelling investment with an attractive growth story in the automotive sector. It is supported by a strong brand presence, international expansion growth, and financial strength. With high expectations, investors should take notice in the premium valuation risks apparent. Long-term growth is certainly compelling but there are clear short-term headwinds including macroeconomic uncertainties that require careful monitoring.

* **Product Diversification:** XPEL is widely known for their paint protection films. These films contribute to 70% of total Q3 sales and grew by 2.7%. Still, products like their window film and ceramic coatings have outperformed with growth of 20.6%. [Non-automotive products](https://s204.q4cdn.com/619560229/files/doc_presentations/2024/11/Q3-2024-XPEL-Investor-Presentation.pdf) like home & office window films, antimicrobial film, and niche surface protection film also out-performed by 11.6%. Together, both segments contributed 30% to total sales. Impressive growth outperformance though has largely been a significant reason for overall revenue growth in recent quarters.
* **International Expansion:** U.S. sales are the largest contributor to total revenue, accounting for 57.2% of the total and reaching $64.6 million in Q3, reflecting year-over-year growth of 9.4%. Despite the reliance on U.S. sales, International sales continue to outperform. Canada is the second largest contributor at 12.8% of revenue with growth of 25.7% to $14.4 million. All international markets saw growth except for the third largest market which is China. China saw a significant decline of -11.6% to just $9.06 million. The decrease was primarily attributed to XPEL's distributor working through excess inventory levels. With only a weighting of 8% of total sales, the negative growth did not hurt overall sales significantly. While XPEL faced challenges in China as well as minor growth of 4.1% and 1.4% in Europe and the U.K, strong international performance lead to record revenue.
* **Strategic Partnerships:** XPEL has established multiple strategic partnerships to expand its market presence. Recent collaborations with brands like [Tesla](https://lp.xpel.com/tesla-window-film), [Kia](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241030688212/en/XPEL-Showcases-New-Products-and-Collaborations-at-SEMA-2024), exclusive [Rivian](https://s204.q4cdn.com/619560229/files/doc_news/XPEL-and-Rivian-Expand-Collaboration-With-New-PPF-and-Window-Film-Program-2024.pdf) supplier partnership, [BMW](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241030688212/en/XPEL-Showcases-New-Products-and-Collaborations-at-SEMA-2024), and [Team Penske](https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelharley/2024/07/10/xpel-partners-with-team-penske-to-protect-indycars-and-drivers/) have been formed. These collaborations, including with service providers like [Tint World](https://www.tintworld.com/news-media/news-and-press/industry-leaders-tint-world-and-xpel-announce-partnership/), have strengthened market presence. Brand visibility and revenue growth have also increased as a result. The Tesla partnership in particular is of major importance due to their dominance in the EV market. These recent collaborations integrate XPEL's wide array of products into solutions for high-profile vehicles and events. The partnerships with Tesla and Rivian are particularly significant. They expand their reach into the electric vehicle market that continues to rapidly grow in the U.S. and internationally.

# Risk Factors:

* **Reliance On Chinese Distribution:** [Potential tariff threats to China](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-importers-rush-goods-china-trump-tariff-threat-looms-2025-01-15/) from a new administration will significantly impact XPEL if enacted. If new tariffs are applied, XPEL will be faced with increases in far materials leading to higher production costs. With the U.S market as the largest source of revenue at 57.2%, passing on further costs to consumers would likely reduce demand. Most importantly, reliance on one distributor could lead to supply chain constraints due to an over-reliance on one company. Price increases or delayed deliveries would harm relationships and hurt XPEL's brand.
* **The Culper Research Short Report:** On October 19, 2023, [Culper Research issued a short report](https://img1.wsimg.com/blobby/go/cc91fda7-4669-4d1b-81ce-a0b8d77f25ab/downloads/Culper_XPEL_10-19-2023.pdf?ver=1733419998410) sending XPEL's stock retreating -17.3% from $51.51 per share to $42.61. A notable accusation was XPEL's understated reliance on Tesla. [XPEL responded](https://ppfmag.com/short-seller-targets-xpel/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) by stating Tesla represented just 5% of 2023 revenue. Secondly, Culper believes XPEL is concealing a massive risk. Their primary supplier, ""Entrotech, Inc"", has formed a [joint venture with PPG Industries](https://news.ppg.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2023/PPG-launches-paint-films-solutions-for-automotive-and-industrial-customers/default.aspx) on May 23, 2023. Lastly, Culper's claim as seen below, would have massive repercussions for XPEL if they are correct.
* **Additional Culper Info:** The validity of Culper's claims on XPEL and others have been [called into question many times](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/827876/000166357721000030/ex99_1.htm) for self-benefiting public statements. What we do know for sure is the joint venture with PPG Industries is in fact truthful. The extent of which XPEL will become obsolete on the other is a highly questionable take. For some reason, Culper did not mention that XPEL stands out due to their DAP software. It is not because of the PPF raw material. Hence, XPEL would know exactly how much material and company their products were installed on. These allegations were made in 2023. XPEL has continued to show strong growth. The company has not skipped a beat.

# Conclusion

XPEL offers an attractive growth story in the automotive industry. This growth is supported by their strong market position and international expansion. The company also has a diverse product portfolio and strategic partnerships. A P/E ratio of 23.98 certainly wouldn't be viewed as cheap by any measures. Still, their P/E is significantly below their five-year average P/E of 41.6. Long-term growth remains compelling with the expectation of double-digit growth in the next two years.

Nonetheless, there are near-term headwinds. Sure, XPEL has displayed a history of growth, but near-term macroeconomic uncertainties regarding tariff concerns are worth monitoring. XPEL must consider how to react to such challenges since their distributor is based in China. For the reasons noted above, we still believe XPEL is a compelling BUY. It offers long-term sustainable growth, strategic partnerships, international expansion, and a strong balance sheet.","['TSLA', 'HMC', 'HYMTF', 'TSLA', 'TSLA', 'TSLA', 'TSLA', 'TSLA']",3,3,3,2025-01-21 13:26:39+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1i6ij9n/xpel_analyzing_growth_potential_in_the_automotive/,0.9994

Stocks,Here are the products and companies most at risk from Trump’s tariff plans,"**Key Points**

* Tariff proposals have put the complex global supply chain front and center as President-elect Donald Trump gets inaugurated on Monday.
* On the campaign trail, Trump said he would add tariffs for goods made in other countries, especially China.
* Those higher costs on sneakers, cars, furniture and more could force many consumers to change their buying habits.

**Tickers mentioned in this article: MAT, ELF, STLA, GM, F, TGT,  KTB, TAP, STZ, GOOS, LAMB**

>Many of the items that U.S. shoppers browse and buy in retailers’ aisles come from far-away factories or farms — a reality that could soon force many consumers to change their buying habits.

>Sneakers, T-shirts, beer and other common household items are often made in countries like China, Mexico and Canada before they wind their way to a big-box retailer, grocer or mall in the U.S. That complex global supply chain is front and center Monday as President-elect Donald Trump gets inaugurated and is widely expected to announce new tariffs on imports.

>While tariffs have become a familiar concept for more Americans since Trump implemented them on metals and other key materials during his first term in office, the levies he has threatened for his return to the White House could have a much bigger effect on household budgets.

>Most people have little grasp of just how many items could see price hikes due to the duties: from avocados to children’s toys, to chocolate and cars, experts told CNBC. Proposed tariffs on products from China, Mexico and Canada — the three largest U.S. trading partners — would likely affect U.S. consumers the most.

>The exact details of those tariffs, including which countries would be affected and how high the duties might be, remain unclear and could change. On the campaign trail, Trump spoke about implementing 10% to 20% tariffs on all countries, and putting levies as high as 60% on Chinese goods.

>While news reports in recent weeks have suggested Trump could scale back his tariff proposals, and could be using them as a negotiating tactic to bend foreign governments to his will, the president-elect has denied those reports.

>Since his first run for president, Trump has argued tariffs will encourage more manufacturing in the U.S. and promote job creation and national security. It’s not just him: President Joe Biden and other Democrats have backed more limited tariffs for the same reasons.

>Regardless, the risk is clear for retailers: Any tariffs would bring extra costs they’d have to absorb, share with producers or pass on to customers by charging higher prices *—* the latter of which is the most likely scenario as the industry is reluctant to sacrifice profits, retail executives and industry experts told CNBC in recent weeks. Major retail trade groups, including the National Retail Federation and Consumer Technology Association, have warned tariffs would effectively become a tax on American businesses and consumers.

>Shoppers are already expecting tariffs to hit their pocketbooks. About 67% U.S. adults surveyed said they think it is very likely or somewhat likely that companies will pass on the cost of tariffs to consumers, according to Morning Consult survey of more than 4,400 people in early December. Even so, the same poll found about 45% of adults back a 10% tariff on all imports, and more than a third of respondents support a 20% duty on all goods and a 60% levy on Chinese imports.

>Ali Furman, consumer markets industry leader for PwC, said tariffs have become the number one topic of discussion among companies working with the consulting firm, and the conversations have reached the top of the C-suite. She said the tariff fallout could be different now than during Trump’s first term, since his new proposal is broader and comes as retailers struggle to convince inflation-weary consumers to spend.

>“It’s not 2017,” she said. “Because there’s a more cost-conscious consumer, you have to be much more thoughtful about passing on those costs to the consumer.”

>“At the same time, you don’t want to come across as anti-tariff or anti-American,” she added.

>Planning for tariffs now is challenging because companies do not know how Trump will proceed. Automotive executives who have spoken with CNBC in recent weeks said they are preparing for several different scenarios but not making any moves until there’s more clarity.

>“We are working, obviously, on scenarios,” Antonio Filosa, head of Stellantis’ North American operations, said. “But yes, we need to await his decisions and after the decision of Mr. Trump and his administration, we will work accordingly.”

>Professor Brett House, an economist from Columbia Business School, said just about every consumer product could see a price increase under the proposals, but some companies have higher exposure than others\*\*.\*\*

>“Something around 50% of U.S. petroleum imports come from Canada. The Trump administration puts tariffs on those, it is unequivocally the case that everything in the United States will become substantially more expensive,” House told CNBC in an interview. “The breadth of the impact that we should expect to see from these tariffs could be enormous and could affect every single thing we produce in the United States and every household and every business. No one will be immune.”

>Here are just some of the everyday items that would be affected if duties on goods from China, Canada and Mexico take effect.

>**China: Sneakers, furniture and toys**

>Within closets, living rooms and children’s playrooms, a range of American household goods originate in China.

>The country is the largest furniture exporter on the globe, according to data from the Home Furnishings Association, a trade group that lobbies on behalf of home goods retailers. In 2023, $32.4 billion in furniture was imported into the U.S., 29% of which came from China, followed close behind by Vietnam, which accounted for 26.5% of imports, according to the HFA, which cited investment banking firm Mann, Armistead & Epperson – one of the furniture industry’s top sources for data. Between 30% and 40% of furniture is produced in the U.S., but as much as 50% of raw materials – like wood, fabrics, hinges and screws – are imported, making price increases on home products difficult to avoid, even if they’re technically “made in America.”

>HFA CEO Shannon Williams said home goods retailers cannot withstand a 60% tariff on China imports and would likely have to move supply chains if Trump’s proposed tariffs went into effect. While tables and couches likely would not cost 60% more, their prices would still rise, said Williams.

>If companies redirected supply chains to Vietnam, where many manufacturers fled during Trump’s first administration, retailers could still face tariffs of 10% to 20% – plus the cost of moving and scaling operations. The tariffs alone could make a $2,000 couch cost as much as $2,200 to $2,400.

>If businesses moved operations to Mexico, which accounted for about 10% of U.S. furniture imports in 2023, a $2,000 couch could cost up to 25% more at $2,500.

>When Trump first announced tariff increases, some industry experts suggested that retailers might eat some of that cost and try to pass some on to the manufacturer to prevent big price hikes for consumers.

>Between 2018 and 2019, when Trump introduced 10% tariffs on certain goods during his first administration, furniture prices increased by about 2.3%, according to the HFA, which cited data from the consumer price index.

>This time around, the tariffs are not only higher, but also the home goods sector is struggling, leaving it less equipped to absorb the cost. Covid-era purchasing, high interest rates and a sluggish housing market have made it a “rough couple years” for the industry, said Williams.

>Beyond furniture, consumers could see another everyday item cost more if higher tariffs take effect: toys.

>Around 80% of toys imported to the U.S. come from China, and the cost of toys made outside of the U.S. could increase by up to 56% under Trump’s proposals, according to the Toy Association, a trade group that lobbies on behalf of the industry.

>That would make a $20 Barbie doll, which has historically been manufactured in China, cost as much as $31.20.

>“If this were to happen, parents could be pushed to buy less expensive, non-compliant toys from unsanctioned, online sellers. These toys often do not meet U.S. safety and quality standards and could be toxic and dangerous to children, putting them at risk,” the Toy Association said in an email to CNBC. “Toys produced by the U.S. toy industry are compliant with rigorous safety and quality standards, and we hope they will remain affordable to American families and not subject to tariffs.” As of the end of 2023, about 50% of toys from Barbie’s parent company Mattel were made in China, according to CEO Ynon Kreiz. This year, Mattel expects less than 40% of its sourcing to come from China so its “exposure in the U.S. to China sourcing is therefore 20%” given the company’s geographic sales mix, Chief Financial Officer Anthony DiSilvestro said.

>“We’ve done a good job mitigating the potential exposure,” DiSilvestro said during a Morgan Stanley retail conference in December. “But to the extent we’re impacted, we would expect to raise prices to offset it.”

>Footwear is another industry with a heavy reliance on China. About 37% of footwear imports came from the country in 2023, followed by about 30% from Vietnam, nearly 9% from Italy and 8% from Indonesia, according to data from the U.S. International Trade Commission

>Nearly 100% of all footwear is imported to the U.S., according to the group.

>Even before Trump’s first term, footwear manufacturers were moving some sourcing out of China as its labor force shrank, the organization’s CEO Matt Priest said. Yet he said it would be unrealistic to return production to the U.S., and moving it to another part of Asia can be difficult.

>Already, some companies have accelerated their plans. Steve Madden said in November that it will reduce the goods it imports from China by as much as 45% over the next year.

>At a press conference on Thursday, Priest said U.S. footwear companies are waiting for clearer policy.

>“All of these actions are inflationary,” he said. “You have to pay the piper somewhere.”

>China isn’t a major manufacturer of cosmetics, but E.l.f. Beauty , a drugstore staple and popular brand among younger shoppers, makes about 80% of its makeup in the region.

>During an interview with CNBC late last year, CEO Tarang Amin said the company could be forced to raise prices if the tariff hikes take effect — a risky move considering its low prices are one of its main draws.

>**Mexico: Cars, beer and avocados**

>Over the last decade, U.S. consumers have developed a bigger appetite for avocados and Mexican beers. They’ve also gotten used to buying cars from major U.S. automakers with a lot of manufacturing in Mexico.

>Tariffs on Mexican imports could endanger those habits, particularly for price-sensitive shoppers.

>Most major automakers have factories in the U.S. However, they still heavily rely on imports from other countries including Mexico to meet American consumer demand.

>Under the North American Free Trade Agreement and the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement that replaced it, automakers increasingly looked to Mexico as a less expensive place to produce vehicles than in the U.S. or Canada.

>Nearly every major automaker operating in the U.S. has at least one plant in Mexico, including the top six-selling automakers that accounted for more than 70% of U.S. sales in 2024.

>The industry is deeply integrated between the countries, with Mexico importing 49.4% of all auto parts from the U.S. In turn, Mexico exports 86.9% of its auto parts production to the U.S., according to the International Trade Administration.

>Wells Fargo estimates that 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada imports would put most of the adjusted earnings of General Motors, Ford Motor and Stellantis at risk. The firm estimates the impact of 5%, 10% and 25% tariffs to be $13 billion, $25 billion and $56 billion, respectively, across the three companies.

>Most notably, GM and Stellantis both have massive plants in Mexico that produce highly profitable full-size pickup trucks. They, along with Ford and others, also have built EVs in Mexico to lower costs.

>Mexico is also home to the top-selling beer in the U.S. In 2023, Constellation Brands’ Modelo overtook the crown from Bud Light. Constellation also owns Corona, which ranks in the top 10 U.S. beer brands, and fast-growing Pacifico.

>All of the company’s beer brands are imported from Mexico, and beer accounted for 85% of the company’s sales in the first three quarters of its fiscal year.

>If Trump implements the tariffs, Constellation’s cost of goods sold would rise by roughly 16%, according to estimates from Wells Fargo Securities.

>The company would likely choose to offset the levies by raising prices, because moving production doesn’t seem like an option due to a 2013 antitrust settlement. Constellation has spent billions of dollars in recent years to expand its Mexican production capacity.

>On the company’s latest earnings conference call, Constellation CEO Bill Newlands said “it’s really too early to hypothesize” about how the tariffs will play out.

>“As you would expect, we have a lot of permutations that we have considered and certainly we’ll adjust our approach depending on what plays out as we go forward,” he told analysts on Jan. 10.

>Uncertainty about tariffs has led a number of Wall Street analysts to downgrade Constellation’s stock since Trump announced his intention to reignite a trade war with Mexico.

>Avocados have proven less easy to substitute than beers.

>The fruit, once a rare sight in U.S. grocery stores, has become a staple of produce displays, thanks to the growing popularity of Mexican food and diets that call for “healthy fats.”

>From June 2023 to June 2024, the U.S. imported more than 2.4 billion pounds of Mexican Hass avocados.

>In the U.S., avocados are grown in California, Florida and Hawaii. But roughly 90% of the avocados eaten in the U.S. are grown in Mexico, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data.

>The country is one of the few places that can produce the fruit year round, ensuring that consumers can eat avocado toast in the summer and guacamole on Super Bowl Sunday.

>Over the years, avocado consumers have proven that they are willing to pay more for the fruit. While avocado demand has roughly doubled over the last decade, prices have also climbed.

>“There’s nothing like an avocado ... There are times of the year that yes, our prices go a little bit higher, but I feel like that is also part of the norm with our consumers. We don’t see a great dip in our consumption when those prices are a little bit higher,” Alvaro Luque, CEO of the nonprofit Avocados from Mexico, told CNBC.

>Chipotle Mexican Grill famously charges a premium for adding guacamole, but the chain’s customers have largely shrugged off price increases across its menu over the last few years. The burrito chain is one of the few restaurant companies that reported traffic growth quarter after quarter last year.

>Outside of avocados and cars, some companies make clothing in Mexico, too. Kontoor Brands , for example, has turned to the region to make some of its Wrangler jeans. While some of its denim currently retails for about $60 at Macy’s, that could rise to as much as $75 with tariffs factored in.

>**Canada: Cars, coats and French fries Tariffs on Canadian goods would be another blow for automakers and car buyers. French fries and winter coats also risk getting pricier for consumers.**

>Canada exported $27 billion of cars in 2022, trailing only crude petroleum as its top export, according to the Observatory of Economic Complexity.

>Tariffs on Canadian vehicles would impact Detroit automakers the most, but there would likely be consequences across the industry depending on changes to parts from suppliers such as Canada-based Magna. Ontario Premier Doug Ford and other politicians and industry officials have described Trump’s tariff proposal as an existential threat to the country’s recovering automotive industry.

>Five automakers — Ford, GM, Stellantis, Toyota Motor and Honda Motor — produced 1.54 million light-duty vehicles last year in the province, largely for U.S. consumers.

>Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer warned on Wednesday that potential 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada would harm the U.S. auto sector, increase vehicle prices and benefit China.

>“Think about this: 70% of all the auto parts we make in Michigan go directly to our neighbors. ... The only winner in that equation is China. They would love nothing more than to watch us cripple American’s auto ecosystem all by ourselves. This is a matter of national security. We cannot let that happen,” she said during a speech at the Detroit Auto Show.

>But it wouldn’t just be the auto industry that feels the pressure from Canadian tariffs.

>Consider the humble French fry: Canada exports roughly $40.5 billion in agricultural goods to the U.S. annually, including $1.7 billion in frozen French fries and other frozen potato products, according to Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, the country’s counterpart to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

>Canada’s frozen French fries largely come from McCain Foods. The Canadian family-owned company says that one out of every four fries eaten globally comes from its facilities. The company has seven Canadian factories and 11 in the U.S, according to its subsidiaries’ websites.

>As the last year has shown, consumers have grown more price sensitive at grocery stores and in fast-food drive-thru lanes, making it unlikely that they’d swallow a price increase offsetting the tariff.

>If Trump does implement steeper tariffs on Canadian goods, McCain could shift even more of its production to the U.S. Suppliers could jump ship to a U.S. rival like Lamb Weston. Luckily, many French fry suppliers, including the Idaho-based Lamb Weston, have expanded their capacity since the Covid pandemic.

>**Tariffs on Canadian goods could also affect apparel.**

>Canada Goose has built its reputation on high-end outerwear for chilly temperatures, made in Canada. About 70% of the retailer’s merchandise is made in the country, and 30% is made in Europe at a factory that the company owns in Romania and at contractors in other parts of the continent.

>A company spokesperson declined to comment on how Canada Goose is preparing for tariffs and whether it will increase prices.

Stocks,"Apple Is Unlikely to Buy Sonos, But Amazon or Spotify Might Consider It",">The woes of speaker maker Sonos have raised the prospect of a takeover, but who might want to buy it? 

>

>For months, Sonos Inc. has been reeling. After a disastrous software rollout last year, the audio technology company that some used to call “the Apple of speakers” remains mired in the biggest crisis in its two-decade history.

>

>It all started in May when the company introduced a revamped app — the software that lets customers control their speakers, soundbars, subwoofers, headphones and other devices. The app was designed to modernize the Sonos experience and lay the groundwork for new types of products, such as the Ace headphones. But it lacked vital features and was hobbled by bugs, turning the simple act of using Sonos equipment into a nightmare.

>

>The missing features — including the sleep timer, advanced music queues, alarms, and functions related to searching and navigating music libraries — have mostly been restored. But users have reported that glitches persist in some cases: Devices don’t pair, audio volume will spike without warning, connections fail, and streaming doesn’t always go smoothly.

>

>Sonos should have never launched the new app the way it did and was aware of many bugs prior to the initial release. It should have kept around the old and reliable S2 app and launched the new version as a beta test. Once the revamped software became as dependable as the old app, Sonos could have moved forward with the new version as the default. Of course, that would have provided less of a splashy marketing opportunity — the chance to flip the switch on a whole new experience.

>

>So here we are. The new app ended up being devastating to employee morale, company revenue and the brand’s reputation. It’s a disaster on par with Apple’s rocky move to its own Maps software from Google in 2012 — a switch that led to the ouster of the company’s software chief. The big difference is that, for Apple, Maps is one app. For Sonos, the change compromised the software underpinning all its products.

>

>Sonos’ board ultimately needed to take action. More than six months after the launch of the app — and even after an apology tour from its executives and a multitude of attempted fixes — the company parted ways with Chief Executive Officer Patrick Spence a week ago. The next day, it also cut loose its chief product officer, who many Sonos employees blamed for the app mess.

>

>In their place is interim CEO Tom Conrad, a co-creator of music streaming service Pandora and former executive at Snap Inc. He has served on the Sonos board since 2017 and was already helping with the app recovery effort. Though the company has vowed to search the globe for a new full-time CEO, many Sonos staffers believe Conrad has the inside track to get the job — if he wants it.

>

>But with Sonos’ market valuation hovering around $1.7 billion — down from more than $5 billion during a pandemic-fueled rally — the board will probably consider whether selling the company makes more sense.

>

>Apple has long been seen as a potential suitor, given the two companies’ similarities. Sonos is focused on premium design with a tightly controlled ecosystem — just like Apple. They share a penchant for audio technology, and their corporate cultures have some overlap.

>

>Apple could snap up Sonos for $2 billion or so — less than it paid for Beats — and it would only cost them a few days’ worth of revenue. Sonos’ hardware could also shore up Apple’s disappointing HomePod and home audio lineup.

>

>But I don’t believe Apple will ever acquire Sonos. If Apple really wanted to build out its home audio business, it already has the hardware, software, content and manufacturing chops internally. It’s just about wanting to get things done properly — something that Apple is already working on. Later this year, it will launch its own home hub and a new HomePod mini.

>

>The only things it would gain from Sonos are a user base, a collection of patents and the employees — none of which Apple needs. Sonos’ software is obviously something Apple wouldn’t want, especially in its current state, and audio hardware has become heavily commoditized.

>

>Other potential suitors, such as Meta Platforms Inc., Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Microsoft Corp., wouldn’t make much sense either. Meta has all but exited the smart home, choosing to focus on AI and wearables instead. Google has a painful history with Sonos involving patent lawsuits. And Microsoft has increasingly scaled back its interest in non-Xbox hardware in recent years.

>

>Still, there are some major technology companies that might consider the idea. That list includes [Amazon.com](http://Amazon.com) Inc., Samsung Electronics Co., Roku Inc. and Spotify Technology SA.

>

>Amazon seems like the most natural fit. With former Microsoft Chief Product Officer Panos Panay now leading its hardware efforts, the expectation is that Amazon will revamp its device lineup and shift toward more upscale offerings. Sonos’ speakers already work with the entire streaming music industry and are certainly high-end.

>

>Sonos’ premium technology could be the basis for a series of new Amazon Echo devices running the upcoming AI-infused Alexa digital assistant. It would also help Amazon expand into new areas, such as over-ear headphones and soundbars — two categories the company has explored in the past.

>

>Amazon could certainly afford to buy Sonos, though it would have to overcome regulatory hurdles. Don’t forget: Amazon had to back out of a deal to buy Roomba maker iRobot Corp. after the European Union threatened to block the acquisition.

>

>A European company like Spotify might have an easier time getting a deal cleared. The streaming music service has championed the idea of hardware products that can run services from several different players, which Sonos does well. Spotify has long wanted to get into hardware but struggled to make it happen. Sonos would give them an instant entry, with an excellent range of products that could run its audio services.

>

>Roku is another possibility, though it would probably face antitrust concerns. After all, the company already sells a set of low-end soundbars and TV speakers. If it could make a deal work, Roku would get higher-end products that can potentially command higher profit margins. One caveat: This may need to be a stock-based deal given Roku doesn’t have as much cash on hand as its bigger rivals.

>

>Samsung is a wild card. The company already sells soundbars and subwoofers and even acquired the Harman brand in 2017. But it’s failed to crack the home speaker space. It announced an Echo-like speaker called the Galaxy Home several years ago but never actually brought it to market. Sonos would help it create a more consumer-focused line of home audio gear and provide more modern technology for its home theater products.

>

>For consumers, the best scenario is probably Sonos figuring things out and remaining independent — the current goal of the company. With the world’s biggest tech giants expanding into every facet of our lives, there is something appealing about an independent brand that plays nice with all the platforms. It’s just unclear how long Sonos will be able to do it alone.

>

>Retail inventory of the current iPhone SE quickly shrinks ahead of new model’s debut. One of Apple’s most significant new products this year will be the the iPhone SE’s replacement. The device — codenamed V59 — will mark the beginning of Apple’s transition from Qualcomm Inc. cellular modem chips to silicon designed in-house. It also means the company will no longer sell an iPhone with the now-antiquated home button. The latest model, which will also add Apple Intelligence, is set to launch by the spring — and there are signs Apple is gearing up for the release.

>

>According to people working in Apple’s retail operations, a surprisingly large number of US stores have little to no inventory of the iPhone SE remaining. Consumers can still get the device from the online store — and it ships out within a few days — but finding one at a brick-and-mortar outlet is going to be harder and harder. Apple also has ceased sales of the current SE in the European Union because the device lacks the now-required USB-C port.

>

>The drawing down of inventory is a reliable sign that a new model is coming. But it also suggests that Apple probably won’t keep the current version around — at a reduced price — after the update is here. That seems like a missed opportunity, since a cheap iPhone could’ve helped Apple make inroads in some markets. The current SE costs $429, and the new one might be more than that given its enhanced features.

>

>This new iPhone isn’t the only big product update on the horizon. As I wrote last week, look out for upcoming MacBook Airs with the M4 “Donan” chip, as well as fresh low-end iPads, iPad Airs and new Magic Keyboards in the not-too-distant future.

>

>Apple is bringing AI to Mac Mail app in macOS 15.4, even as it scales back notification summaries in iOS 18.3. The Apple Intelligence rollout is continuing with the release of macOS 15.3 in a few weeks. For the first time, Apple is bringing its Genmoji custom emoji to the Mac — following their debut on the iPhone and iPad. The company will add more features by April with iOS 18.4 and macOS 15.4. The big addition at that time will be the new Siri digital assistant, which will be able to better tap into personal information and use the App Intents technology to more precisely control apps.

>But there’s another, more under-the-radar feature coming in April as well: The Mac will get the upgraded Mail app that uses AI to prioritize messages and sort content into different inboxes. Right now, iPad and iPhone users are able to tap into the feature — which is terrific — but Mac customers have been left behind. That changes with macOS 15.4, I’m told. For those not familiar with the feature: It sorts mail into a primary category, as well as ones for transactions, promotions, updates and all mail.

>In other Apple Intelligence news, the company is scaling back notification summaries in iOS 18.3 and macOS 15.3. For months, news organizations and users have been complaining about incorrect or misleading notifications from Apple Intelligence. Rather than quickly fixing its AI models, Apple is simply pulling the plug on summaries from news and entertainment apps. You can also more easily disable summaries from the lock screen, and recaps are now italicized.

>Apple’s ex-chief people officer lands at HP. It’s not easy to join Apple after a career outside the company. The place is run by big personalities like Tim Cook, Phil Schiller, Greg Joswiak and others who have been there for several decades. In other words, if you’re walking into Apple thinking you’re going to change how it operates, you’re in for a surprise.

>

>That was the case with Carol Surface, who joined Apple in 2023 as chief people officer after working at Medtronic Plc, Best Buy Co. and PepsiCo Inc. She flamed out after less than two years. Stella Low, Apple’s short-lived vice president of communications, ran into similar issues in 2022.

>

>Both women were hired by Cook himself and stayed at Apple for way less time than anticipated, but now they have another thing in common: They landed at HP Inc. afterward. Low joined the computer maker as its chief communications officer in 2022 and recently left. Surface just agreed to join HP and is starting March 24. Given Surface’s successful and varied human resources career prior to Apple, she could end up being a good fit for HP.

>

>Speaking of Apple’s insidery culture: It was no surprise that Surface’s role was ultimately filled by Deirdre O’Brien, her predecessor and a 30-plus-year veteran of the company. Low, meanwhile, was replaced by Kristin Huguet, a member of Apple’s PR department since before the original iPhone went on sale.

>

>They’re both capable leaders, but Apple will eventually need to figure out how to bring in more talent from the outside. Right now, the company isn’t always built to handle fresh ideas from newcomers. With Apple’s need to innovate and find new sources of revenue, that might be a problem in the not-too-distant future.

**The Schedule**

>Jan. 22 — Samsung unveils Galaxy S25 line. Samsung is set to announce its Galaxy S25 smartphone lineup at its Unpacked event this week in San Jose, California. This year’s devices aren’t expected to get a major hardware overhaul, with the company instead focusing more on software and artificial intelligence features. But Samsung aims to show that it has an edge over Apple in this area. Stay tuned for coverage of Unpacked this week, including all of the details of the new devices. And if you’re waiting for news on Samsung smartwatches and foldable phones, those will likely debut later in the year.

>

>Jan. 30 — Apple’s first-quarter results. The earnings report — the first under Chief Financial Officer Kevan Parekh — will give details of Apple’s all-important holiday season. Investors will get an idea of how the iPhone 16 is selling, as well as updated AirPods and Apple Watches. The company also should provide the first real sense of whether the Apple Intelligence AI platform is spurring consumers to upgrade their devices. Wall Street is looking for about $124 billion in revenue during the period, a 4% gain from a year earlier.

>

>**Post Game Q&A**

>Q: Why is Tim Cook attending the Trump inauguration?

>A: Many Apple employees are none too pleased that their CEO is heading to Washington to kiss the ring and attend Trump’s swearing-in event on Monday. (Cook also personally donated $1 million to the inauguration fund.) The move seems to clash with Apple’s support of diversity, immigration and other progressive causes — ones that Cook himself has championed. But it’s equally clear that Apple may need Trump’s help over the next four years as it contends with tariffs, the Justice Department antitrust case and mounting pressure from the European Union. Cook likely believes Trump can alleviate these problems. He’s also not alone in turning out for the president-elect. Most of the world’s most valuable tech companies are sending a high-profile leader to the event.

>

>Q: When are the new Powerbeats Pro 2 launching?

>A: The latest earbuds from Apple’s Beats subsidiary are due imminently. The new accessory has already been submitted to the Federal Communications Commission and other regulators for approval, and the company is gearing up for a press briefing in a week or so to go over the details of the new product. The upgrades will feature a smaller overall design and improvements like Spatial Audio and enhanced noise cancellation that are already available on AirPods. The programming code within iOS also suggests that these earbuds could be capable of collecting heart-rate data from a wearer. I’ve previously reported that Apple is working on this technology and actively testing it.

>

>Q: Why is Apple starting to use US-made chips?

>A: A major, under-discussed risk facing Apple right now is that practically 100% of its advanced processors are made in Taiwan by partner TSMC. If Taiwan goes down for whatever reason (a political crisis, natural disaster or something else), Apple is in big trouble with no real plan B. That’s why moving more production to other areas is so critical, and such a shift is now underway. TSMC is running test production of lower-end Apple chips at a facility in Arizona, the first step toward more ambitious goals. Over time, Apple hopes to get chips from other factories in the US and elsewhere, including Europe. Let’s face it, the company has been fairly lucky so far that its chip production hasn’t suffered major hiccups. Apple’s reliance on one geographic location for the most important component in its devices has been a major hazard for years.

Stocks,Thoughts on ticktok ban and how would it impact meta stocks (worth shorting meta stocks?),"It seems like a significant number of TikTok users are growing frustrated with platforms like Facebook and Messenger, with many potentially rage-quitting or deleting these apps altogether. Considering TikTok’s massive user base—about 1 billion globally and 170 million in the U.S.—even a fraction of this shift could create a noticeable impact on Meta.

The question is, how might this trend affect Meta’s stock? On one hand, Meta has faced declines before and adapted through diversification and innovations like Instagram Reels. On the other, losing younger users—key to ad revenue—could hurt them long-term, especially with TikTok growing as a major competitor.

While Meta’s resources and global reach may help cushion the blow, the perception of a mass exodus could still shake investor confidence. Is this a temporary issue Meta can counter, or could it signal a deeper shift in the social media landscape?

Stocks,The great scam market ,"I posted a similar Topic in a couple of other subs yesterday but Mods were quickly removing them  on the basis that the question was too "" subjective "" 

  
Anyway I've been working on a theory for a few years now that the markets have very very little to do with actual company performance or metrics and everything to do about Mass perception and psychology 

  
Almost every day now I see a trader trying to analyse a stock based on a Shiller ratio or a Buffet Indicator or pattern whatever ...

  
Are we really going to kid ourselves the markets are trading on these metrics anymore !?! if so how do we explain Big Tech ? most of the valuations defy every piece of logical or rational explanation

  
A share price can move more on 4 lines of text from an individual on a social media site than on a full quarters earnings report 

  
Then allow me to move into day trading which is perhaps the most manipulated aspect of the entire show , we've known since the dawn of time Tutes and Hedges have the upper hand but now I believe with A.I trading algorithms thats been taken to a level whereby there's literal fraud happening on a daily basis

If you think this is crazy conspiracy level stuff try researching algorithmic and cryptographic trading signals

These theories and technology's speculate that these trading Algos can now actually communicate between each other via a certain price signal and then work together to shift the market higher or lower 

You can't beat this , yea you can get lucky and maybe be on the right side of the coin when it happens but generally over a sustained period these are cleverly programmed to bleed day traders out and to often go against Mass assumption 

This explains the very odd situation whereby sometimes a company gets bad news the stock actually ends up trading higher and vice versa. This is a strange Phenomenon most traders can never explain or comprehend so its often passed of as "" oh markets just being irrational"" 

No that's a lie its being done intentionally to Fvck the opposite positions 

Tesla is a fantastic example of everything I've talked about above really the daily and weekly price movement needs to investigated by the SEC for securities fraud ( it won't) but I believe a deep forensic analysis would uncover a body of manipulation and fraud 

Long term we all know the overall stock market will keep going higher and higher forever which I guess means locking capital in for 40 years into ETF's  makes the most sense , but again the big boys know dam well Retail gets impatient and wants faster gain and will try to make daily / weekly or monthly trades

( more market phsychology ) 

  
Theres a lot of FOMO out there now too which further exacerbates many traders need to get in on the action 

  
This is exactly what Tutes/ Hedges and Banks want ......it's their bread and butter 

Anyway looking forward to hearing others opinions , I'm not particularly interested in discussing if this is a conspiracy or not because frankly its brutally obvious a lot of this is happening in some context and you would be very very Naive to think otherwise 

 But maybe I have some angles or aspects wrong or maybe I've missed something somebody else wants to add

Stocks,Intel Shares Jump on Report It’s an Acquisition Target,"Intel Corp. shares jumped as much as 9.5% Friday morning after a report on a technology news site said the beleaguered chipmaker is an acquisition target.

SemiAccurate, a tech-focused newsletter founded by Charlie Demerjian, said it was “read an email about a company trying to acquire Intel, whole” and that the “mystery company has the resources to pull it off.” The report did not name the firm potentially interested in buying Intel.

Once the world’s dominant chipmaker, Intel has struggled in recent years to keep up in a competitive and fast-changing industry. Last month, Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger was forced out after the board lost confidence in his plans to turn around the iconic company. Its stock fell 60% last year, and the shares are only now back at their level from early December. Its market valuation is about $90 billion.

Buyers have circled Intel even before Gelsinger’s ouster and takeover speculation has accelerated since then. Qualcomm Inc. approached Intel to discuss a potential acquisition before eventually cooling on the idea, Bloomberg reported last year. Arm Holdings Plc similarly inquired about possibly buying Intel’s product division, but was told the business wasn’t for sale, Bloomberg reported in September.

Intel couldn’t immediately be reached for comment.

Secondary, how and where is It reccomended to start? I can dedicate a some hours a week for it, but not sure where to begin 


Lastly, should I start from a test amount (let's say 1k$) and then invest more and more? Or should I reinvest the entirety of it right away?

Stocks,Microsoft raises price of consumer version of Microsoft 365 for first time since 2013,"Microsoft is adding artificial intelligence tools to its consumer Microsoft 365 bundle and bumping up the price for the first time since introducing subscriptions 12 years ago.

In a blog post Thursday, Microsoft said it’s bringing its Copilot AI assistant into the Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook and OneNote applications for consumers who have the Microsoft 365 suite.

The increase of $3 per month is meant “to reflect the extensive subscription benefits that we’ve added over the past 12 years and enable us to deliver new innovations for years to come,” Bryan Rognier, vice president of Microsoft 365 Consumer, wrote in the post.

Microsoft 365 Personal will now cost $9.99 per month and $99.99 per year, up from $6.99 per month and $69.99 per year. The Microsoft 365 Family plan, which serves up to six people, will cost $12.99 per month and $129.99 per year, up from $9.99 a month and $99.99 per year.

Microsoft had 84.4 million consumer subscribers to Microsoft 365 in the September quarter, up 10%. Existing customers will see the new prices upon renewal, according to the blog post.

Formerly known as Office 365, Microsoft 365 is important to the company’s efforts to compete with Google’s productivity tools in the consumer market. But sales to businesses are far more lucrative for Microsoft.

Microsoft 365 commercial products and cloud services represented 31% of the company’s fiscal third-quarter revenue, while Microsoft 365 consumer products and cloud services contributed less than 3%. In 2022, Microsoft increased prices of commercial Microsoft 365 subscriptions for the first time.

In addition to bringing Copilot into the Microsoft 365 applications, consumer subscribers will gain access to Microsoft Designer, an AI image editing tool.

Microsoft said that, for a limited time, existing subscribers can switch to plans without Copilot or other AI.

“These plans will continue to be maintained as they exist today, but for certain new innovations and features you’ll need a Microsoft 365 Personal and Family subscription,” the company said.

Stocks,Snap shares drop as FTC refers MyAI chatbot complaint to the DOJ,"Snap shares closed down 5% on Thursday after the Federal Trade Commission said it would refer a complaint against the company to the Department of Justice.

The FTC’s non-public complaint involves allegations that Snapchat’s My AI chatbot poses “risks and harms to young users,” the commission said in a statement. The complaint stems from the FTC’s compliance reviews with Snap following a 2014 settlement regarding allegations of public deception pertaining to data collection by the company.

As part of the FTC’s compliance reviews of Snap, the agency said it had uncovered the possibility that the company “is violating or is about to violate the law.”

“A proceeding is in the public interest,” the FTC said in its statement.

The FTC did not specify what about the My AI chatbot its complaint was focused on, but the chatbot has previously drawn scrutiny.

A Snap spokesperson pushed back against the FTC’s claims in a statement to CNBC.

“Unfortunately, on the last day of this Administration, a divided FTC decided to vote out a proposed complaint that does not consider any of these efforts, is based on inaccuracies, and lacks concrete evidence,” the Snap spokesperson said. “It also fails to identify any tangible harm and is subject to serious First Amendment concerns.”

The spokesperson added that while the company shares the FTC’s “focus on ensuring the thoughtful development of generative AI,” Snap believes that the “complaint would stifle innovation and competition in a critical and growing sector of the economy.”

Snap debuted the My AI chatbot in 2023. It is powered by the large language models of OpenAI and Google, giving it the ability to answer user questions and provide tips and suggestions similar to ChatGPT and other AI-powered chatting tools.

The chatbot has been noted for providing problematic responses. In one instance while speaking with a reporter who was pretending to be a teenager, the chatbot answered explained how to hide the smell of alcohol and marijuana, The Washington Post reported in 2023. At the time of the chatbot’s initial release, Snap said that My AI, like other AI-powered chatbots, is “prone to hallucination and can be tricked into saying just about anything. Please be aware of its many deficiencies and sorry in advance!”

In Oct. 2013, the United Kingdom’s Information Commissioner’s Office issued a preliminary enforcement notice against Snap, alleging that the company’s My AI-related risk assessment “did not adequately assess the data protection risks posed by the generative AI technology, particularly to children.”

Although the FTC said that it voted during a closed meeting to issue a public statement about it’s case against Snap and its ensuing referral to the DOJ, it noted that FTC commissioners Melissa Holyoak and Andrew Ferguson were absent.

The FTC also pointed to a dissenting statement by Ferguson, who President-elect Donald Trump named in December to replace Lina Khan as the next FTC chair.

Ferguson noted that these kinds of referrals “are not disclosed unless and until the complaint is filed in court by the Department or the Commission.”

“I did not participate in the farcical closed meeting at which this matter was approved,” he wrote.

Ferguson added that he opposes the FTC’s complaint against Snap, but that he can’t “release a detailed analysis of its many problems,” because the case is not public. Ferguson wrote that the complaint’s interpretations of an FTC law is “wrong” and that it is “in direct conflict with the guarantees of the First Amendment.”

If the DOJ files the complaint, Ferguson said he will “release a more detailed statement about this affront to the Constitution and the rule of law.”

Stocks,Thought on Academy Sports & Outdoors?,"Many retail stocks have notably struggled in recent years due to numerous macroeconomic issues such as inflation and cut back on consumer spending. E-commerce giants like Amazon & Walmart continue to take market share and offer products much cheaper. A direct competitor for ASO is Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS). While Academy has struggled, Dick's has flourished with impressive growth.

For Academy, they have faced notable challenges over the past few years, including declining sales and heightened competition. However, brighter days appear to be ahead as management executes strong growth initiatives. On track to open 20 to 25 new stores in 2025, Academy plans to increase its store base by 50% in the coming years, targeting 442 to 462 locations. These efforts build on ASO’s industry-leading productivity, with $22 million in sales per store—47% higher than Dick’s Sporting Goods. By expanding beyond its Southern U.S. base, Academy has a significant runway for growth in both existing and new markets.

In addition to store expansion, ASO is leveraging private-label goods, which currently account for 21% of sales, to enhance profitability and differentiate itself in the competitive retail space. These exclusive offerings appeal to value-conscious consumers while improving margins. The company’s focus on e-commerce and omnichannel integration further strengthens its position. Despite e-commerce sales comprising only 8.8% of Q3 2025 revenue, initiatives like curbside pickup, same-day delivery, and loyalty programs are designed to drive long-term growth.

Moreover, Academy consistently delivers value to shareholders. Its $700 million share buyback program, alongside a history of increasing dividends, underscores strong free cash flow and financial discipline. Trading at a P/E ratio well below industry peers, ASO offers investors a high-quality business at an attractive valuation. With improved comparable same-store sales and a solid balance sheet, Academy is well-positioned to capitalize on its strategic initiatives, providing significant upside potential for long-term investors.

Curious as to everyone's thoughts on them.

Stocks,TSMC net profit hits record high as fourth-quarter results top expectations on robust AI chip demand,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company’s fourth-quarter revenue and profit beat expectations, as demand for advanced chips used in artificial intelligence applications continued to surge.

Here are TSMC’s fourth-quarter results versus LSEG consensus estimates:

Net revenue: 868.46 billion New Taiwan dollars ($26.36 billion), vs. NT$850.08 billion expected
Net income: NT$374.68 billion, vs. NT$366.61 billion expected

TSMC profit rose 57% from a year earlier to a record high, while revenue jumped 38.8%. The firm had forecast fourth-quarter revenue between $26.1 billion and $26.9 billion.

As the world’s largest contract chip manufacturer TSMC produces advanced processors for clients such as Nvidia and Apple and has benefited from the megatrend in favor of AI.

TSMC’s high-performance computing division, which encompasses artificial intelligence and 5G applications, drove sales in the fourth quarter, contributing 53% of revenue. That HPC revenue was up 19% from the previous quarter.

“The surging demand for AI chips has exceeded expectations in Q4,” Brady Wang, associate director at Counterpoint Research told CNBC, adding that revenue was also bolstered by demand for the advanced chips in Apple’s latest iPhone 16 model.

The Taiwan-based company first released its December revenue last week, bringing its annual total to NT$ 2.9 trillion — a record-breaking year in sales since the company went public in 1994.


“We observed robust AI related demand from our customers throughout 2024,” Wendell Huang, chief financial officer and vice president at TSMC, said in an earnings call on Thursday, adding that revenue from AI accelerator products accounted for “close to a mid-teens percentage” of total revenue in 2024.

“Even after more than tripling in 2024, we forecast our revenue from AI accelerators to double in 2025 as a strong surge in AI-related demand continues as a key enabler of AI applications,” Huang added.

However, TSMC may face some headwinds in 2025 from U.S. restrictions on advanced semiconductor shipments to China and uncertainty surrounding the trade policy of President-elect Donald Trump.

TSMC Chairman and CEO C.C. Wei said the company will not attend Trump’s inauguration as its philosophy is to keep a low profile, Reuters reported.

Trump, who will assume office next week, has threatened to impose broad tariffs on imports and has previously accused Taiwan of “stealing” the U.S. chip business. .

Still, Counterpoint’s Wang forecasts 2025 to be another strong year for TSMC, with significant revenue growth fueled by strong and expanding demand for AI applications, both in diversity and volume.

Taiwan-listed shares of TSMC gained 81% in 2024 and were trading 3.75% higher on Thursday.

Stocks of European semiconductor companies trading on the Euronext Amsterdam Stock Exchange rose Thursday, with ASML
 up 3.5%, ASM International
 gaining 3.75% and Besi
 rising 5.1%.

Stocks,Another catalyst for Amazon $AMZN,"Why I Love Amazon

Amazon isn’t just an e-commerce giant; it’s an ecosystem with diverse revenue streams that touch nearly every part of our lives. From its robust retail operations and cloud computing powerhouse AWS to its advertising business, device sales, and subscription services like Prime, Amazon has mastered the art of innovation and scale.

One of my favorite aspects is Amazon Prime, a service that bundles so much value into one membership. Beyond free shipping, Prime offers access to Prime Video, music streaming, exclusive deals, and more—making it a must-have for millions of households globally.

A recent highlight from Prime Video is its record-breaking performance in NFL streaming. The Steelers-Ravens playoff game brought in an impressive 22.07 million average viewers, setting a new high for Amazon’s sports streaming efforts. While this figure lags behind Netflix’s Christmas Day NFL stream and traditional broadcasters like Fox and CBS for other playoff games, it’s a significant milestone. More importantly, Amazon’s partnership with the NFL is driving Prime subscriptions and ad revenue. Their Thursday Night Football viewership grew 13% year-over-year in 2024, showcasing their ability to compete in the fiercely contested live sports space.

Looking ahead, this is just the beginning for Amazon. With its unique ability to blend commerce, media, and technology, their continued investment in live sports and other high-impact content will be transformative—not just for Prime Video but for the entire ecosystem. The future looks huge for Amazon, and that’s why I admire their vision and execution.","['AMZN', 'AMZN', 'AMZN', 'AMZN', 'AMZN', 'AMZN', 'NFLX', 'AMZN', 'AMZN', 'AMZN']",6,35,17,2025-01-16 07:58:54+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1i2k28u/another_catalyst_for_amazon_amzn/,0.9837

Luckily, after a streak of bad news uber finally started getting some upgrades and even Announced an accelerated buy back. 

That said, recently there has also been rumors of Lyft getting bought by Amazon. If that were to happen I think it would be be very negative for uber. I am contemplating bailing out here break even as this company seems to be in the crosshairs of potential disruption.

Stocks,Novice Question on Profit Percentages (E-Trade),"Hello, quick question from someone with minimal knowledge.  I purchased stocks back in 2020-21 for the first time and then left them.  Some have appreciated in value nicely, but I noticed an interesting discrepancy. 

When I look at my ""watch list"" on E-Trade for Broadcom, which I placed on the list during the crash 3/23/20, I see that the ""change in value"" is +9000% since that date according to the app.  This is slightly bigger than Nvidia over the same period.   However, I bought the stock within a month of that time, and it has ""only"" appreciated about 700% in value since then.  

I'm perfectly happy with the investment, but I was curious what explains the 10x discrepancy between the watch list change and the tax lot gain for roughly the same period.  I imagine part of it is that I didn't buy at rock bottom - but is that it?

Stocks,"Salesforce ($CRM) will lead (and profit from) the AI ""Digital Worker"" revolution","**TLDR:**  AI will start replacing jobs at a faster pace in 2025.  Salesforce has first-mover advantage in Agentic AI - a **$7t** market.  Expect the stock to shoot up as sales agreements and milestones are announced over the coming months.
________________________________

I feel like the market is sleeping on Salesforce.  All this cash being spent on GenAI/datacenters is so that these models can be utilized in a software solution that make workers more efficient.  So far it's the best way to monetize AI, and it's exactly what Salesforce is hyper-focused on.  In my mind, I don’t see how Salesforce doesn't end up dominating the Agentic AI space, and making a ton of money doing it.

Since a lot of people much smarter than I am are selling the stock, maybe I’m missing something.  I’d appreciate if you could take a look through my post and let me know your thoughts.

**Positions:**  ~$25k shares, ~$10k calls generally targeting $450 by Dec 2025.  Will continue to buy through to the end of the month, to total around $50k.

________________________________


##Salesforce has first dibs on the new “Digital Worker” market

There’s a general anxiety that eventually, AI will take everyone’s job.  While it’s safe to say that much of the labour force has nothing to worry about in the coming decade, there are some jobs that AI would consider low-hanging fruit:  call center staff, sales/project coordinators, customer success reps...  These types of jobs could be replaced much sooner than the rest.

The market is teetering near all-time highs waiting to see whether the AI bubble will solidify, or pop.  Many have said that AI is all hype, and that until the technology makes significant advancements, the rising valuations are unwarranted.  Many others think that the AI hype will be confirmed as real in the near future.

Salesforce, in the meantime, is accepting the challenge.  In Sept ’24 they announced Agentforce, an Agentic AI platform, which they released a month later.  In December, they announced Agentforce 2.0, which includes additional features.  It seems like they’ve got all hands on deck building and selling this new product.  Benioff (CEO) is pretty shamelessly hocking the product as well to anyone that will listen.

In my opinion, Salesforce is pivoting away from being a CRM company, to an Agentic AI company.  In the coming years, Agentforce revenue will make up a higher and higher percentage of their revenue.  As their AI advances, it stands to reason that Agentforce will even cannibalize CRM seats – for much more revenue, of course.

[Digital labour is predicted to be a $7t market in the coming years](https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/articles/generative-ai-could-raise-global-gdp-by-7-percent), and Salesforce appears to be the first-mover, on top of already having the advantage of being the biggest SaaS company in the world.  I don’t see how this plays out any other way than them taking a good chunk of the $7t market for themselves.

###Reasons I’m bullish
#####1. Massive existing customer base with an easy upsell
They are deeply entrenched with thousands customers (including 90% of the Fortune 500).  A lot of them already have Slack installed.  For some of the bigger accounts, they are already hosting training-relevant data in “Data Cloud”.  For many clients, it’s possible that deploying agents would require not much more than a bit of configuration.  Licensing model is “pay-as-you-go”, so sign-ups should be easy to get. Agentforce revenue should start hitting the books fairly soon.

#####2. New clients/segments
Salesforce can use the promise of efficient digital labour to close customers that were previously on the fence.  On top of that, they can now approach segments that had no prior interest in Salesforce at all.  (See the recently announced [Agentforce for Retail](https://www.salesforce.com/news/press-releases/2025/01/10/agentforce-retail-cloud-pos-announcement/))

#####3.	The Benioff Factor
You don’t have to like the guy, but Benioff is pushing Agentforce like his life depended on it.  Given his track record with Salesforce and the sheer shamelessness in his recent behaviour on social media (which I only recently started paying attention to), I can’t help but see him as a positive factor as it relates to the success of the Agentforce launch and the stock in general.

Recently Benioff has ingratiated himself to Musk over social media.  [Last month, Benioff suggested that Musk’s DOGE could use Agentic AI to reduce costs in government.](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/salesforce-ceo-marc-benioff-doge-has-a-real-shot-at-cutting-costs-and-new-technologies-could-help-131314725.html)  It's possible DOGE recommends AI agents as a govt cost-cutting measure.  Salesforce is ready for that:

> ""We already have relationships with a lot of government agencies. We're already talking to them about how to bring this technology in to create more efficient agencies. And we want to continue to have even more conversations, not just with the US government, but all the governments that we have relationships within the world, really all companies. Everybody needs to embrace this technology,"" Benioff said.

#####4. All Hands On Deck
Salesforce has practically rebranded itself as an Agentic AI company in the past few months.  It has reconfigured the organization to focus almost entirely on Agentforce.  If they were simply releasing a new AI feature, then there would be a risk of, for example, Microsoft announcing a competing product, or ServiceNow being a serious contender.  But as it stands, simply due to the fact that they are not holding anything back, there will be no catching up to Agentforce.

#####5. Agentforce used internally at Salesforce
Benioff has stated that Salesforce is using Agentforce internally and that it is already significantly reducing the workload on staff.  If true, this is extremely bullish for two reasons.  Obviously, it serves as a POC for their customers, making Agentforce not only easier to sell, but quicker to deploy.  For me though, a more interesting take on this is that Benioff now needs to demonstrate a visible reduction in Salesforce operating expenses, which should increase net profit.  This would need to be shown on the next earnings call, on both reported numbers, and FY26 forecasts.

#####6. 2025 – the year of Agentic AI
AI will be the focus in 2025 as the market tries to justify the Mag 7’s furious spending on AI infrastructure.  In the past week both Jensen Huang and Satya Nadella have made statements claiming that Agentic AI is where SaaS is going.  If that is indeed the focus of 2025, and if Salesforce/Benioff continue screaming to anyone that will listen that they are 100% all in, it should create excitement around both the product, as well as the stock.  

#####7. Fundamentals

Salesforce is fairly priced at the moment, with a FP/E of 26.  Compared to other SaaS companies like ServiceNow (60) or HubSpot (77) it's an absolute bargain.  It's priced even better than Microsoft (34).  

#####8.	Future Potential (watch as I go off the deep end)
Agentforce is only the first step.  As AI develops, a more advanced version will essentially function as a fully capable employee, with access to all company data posted on Salesforce Data Cloud.  It will also have access to abstracted data across all of Salesforce, making it the most knowledgeable, experienced salesperson(?) in the world.

Is that a bit farfetched?  Maybe.  Impossible?  I don’t think so...  But what’s true, is that Salesforce is the only company with access to all that data.  I think it's likely that they will ultimately be able to pull it off.

###Bearish points + counter-arguments:

#####1.	New business model

Agentforce comes at a price tag of $2 per conversation.  I don’t think we know what that means yet, because this technology and the use-case is entirely new.  How many Agentforce conversations will an Enterprise customer use per month?  10,000?  500,000?  How many of the agent use-cases will actually perform well?  It’s going to be very hard to forecast revenue growth in the coming year, which adds uncertainty.  (Contrast this, for example, to a licensing model where users would simply have to upgrade to a license that cost an additional 30%.)

**Counter:**  While it’s hard to predict the expected revenue growth in the coming months, the positive angle is that this pricing model shows Salesforce’s extreme confidence in the product.  (Microsoft, to compare, has bundled CoPilot onto their M365 subscription service and increased pricing, without giving the customer any choice in the matter.)  It’s possible uptake will be a bit slow, I guess... but if customers do sign on (and thousands of them already have), Agentforce revenue should only go up as the offering improves and customers learn how to make better use of it.

#####2.	Everyone is using AI agents – Salesforce isn’t doing anything special

All companies are using AI agents already.  Salesforce isn’t doing anything special.  They’re just trying to pump their stock by building a product that does “AI”.

**Counter:**  Of course some companies are building AI agents, and they’ll obviously continue to do so.  But when it comes to workflow automation within Salesforce integrated solutions, all this stuff comes out of the box with Agentforce.  The customer doesn't have to build anything.  Generally, companies do not want to get involved with developing custom solutions for internal processes.

#####3.	Competition from other SaaS Companies

There are other companies in the space working on Agentic AI (ie, ServiceNow, HubSpot).  They may build a better product causing Agentforce to flop.  Salesforce is too old and decrepit to compete.

**Counter:**

* Neither of these companies come close to how entrenched/integrated Salesforce is with Enterprise customers.  It’s unrealistic to expect that their products would be so much better, to the point where a major customer chooses them over their existing Salesforce setup.

* Despite being ancient compared to some other SaaS companies, Salesforce regularly releases new major product lines.

* Competitors won’t be able to match Salesforce’s breadth across segments – particularly into Enterprise.

#####4.	Agentic AI won’t be good enough to replace workers

In the same way that nobody likes the chatbots that show up on websites to help (aka Clippy), Agentic AI will never be as good as a human at getting work done.  Over the next year, customers might decide that Agentforce doesn’t work well for them, and simply not use it that much.

**Counter:**

* Customers wouldn’t need to have the AI do everything on its own.  Some tasks would be left to humans.  There are plenty of simpler, more transactional tasks, though, that can be automated, freeing humans to spend more time on more complex ones.

* In many cases, I imagine customers would be willing to reduce service quality by 10% if it meant cost savings of 90%.

* It’s possible to argue that for some tasks, the AI would actually do a better job than the human.  (No typos, no missed messages, quicker task resolution, etc)

#####5.	Analysts forecast mediocre growth, even in 2026

Revenue growth over Salesforce’s FY2026 (which starts in April) is projected at 9%, which isn’t great.  While Agentforce might be a quality product, it would be too early to generate meaningful revenue.

**Counter:**  There is no reason to assume Agentforce should take so long to start generating meaningful revenue.

* Agentforce has a tiny sales cycle.  Enterprise customers already have it included in their licensing
* The tool is built into Salesforce.  Some agents can be set up in under an hour.
* With Agentic AI being a trend in 2025, customers should be more eager to implement it.","['MSFT', 'MSFT', 'MSFT']",33,66,47,2025-01-15 10:54:05+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1i1uwe9/salesforce_crm_will_lead_and_profit_from_the_ai/,0.9994
Stocks,The role of ROCm in AMD's future,"I've recently bought some AMD shares because the share price does not seem to reflect the progress they are making on the hardware front.

I'm considering buying more shares but I find it hard to pull the trigger because the adoption of ROCm seems to be lacking.

I've tried to get a sense of ROCm vs. CUDA usage in as many ways as I could find:

\- Google search trends  
\- Github statistics of the official ROCm repository  
\- Github statistics of the TensorFlow and PyTorch library  
\- Package manager statistics of ROCm related packages (including TensorFlow and PyTorch)  
\- Dockerhub statistics of ROCm related images

I understand that these statistics are not going to reflect the reality but they do give an (albeit indirect) sense of the difference in adoption.

It seems that CUDA easily has 10X more usage and activity than ROCm and I currently don't see how AMD is going to be able to turn that around.

If AMD AI related hardware stays on par with Nvidia's counterparts or only slightly outperforms them, there is nearly no incentive for companies to make the switch to ROCm unless they use unforked TensorFlow or PyTorch solutions.

Large companies usually operate on forked versions of these frameworks to suit their own particular needs and are also highly likely to have several projects directly integrating with CUDA which makes the switch to ROCm very costly.

How large a role do you guys think the adoption of ROCm will play in the future of AMD and how do you see AMD incentivizing large companies to make the switch from CUDA?","['AMD', 'AMD', 'AMD', 'AMD', 'NVDA', 'AMD', 'AMD']",30,19,12,2025-01-14 20:17:01+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1i1fe4x/the_role_of_rocm_in_amds_future/,0.8677
Stocks,Meta announces 5% cuts in preparation for 'intense year' — Read the internal memo,"Meta is set to cut about 5% of its workforce, focusing on the company’s lowest-performing staffers, CNBC confirmed Tuesday.

CEO Mark Zuckerberg informed employees about the decision to “move out low performers faster” in a memo posted on the company’s internal Workplace forum on Tuesday. Zuckerberg told employees 2025 will “be an intense year.”

The company specified that it is “exiting approximately 5% of our lowest performers” in a separate message posted by a company director. The company has more than 72,000 employees, according to its most recent quarterly report.

Meta said employees affected by the cuts will be notified by Feb. 10 and receive severance in line with what the company has provided previously. The cuts represent Meta’s largest layoffs since the company eliminated 21,000 jobs, or nearly a quarter of its workforce, in 2022 and 2023.

Bloomberg was first to report the cuts, citing an internal memo.

The move follows several major operational changes within Meta aimed at building closer ties with President-elect Donald Trump.

Last week, Zuckerberg announced Meta would end its third-party fact-checking program in favor of a “Community Notes” model used on Elon Musk’s platform X, where individual users provide more context to posts.

“The recent elections also feel like a cultural tipping point towards once again prioritizing speech, so we’re going to get back to our roots and focus on reducing mistakes, simplifying our polices and restoring free expression on our platforms,” Zuckerberg said in a video announcement.

Below is Zuckeberg’s internal memo, which CNBC obtained:

""Meta is working on building some of the most important technologies of the world. AI, glasses as the next computing platform and the future of social media. This is going to be an intense year, and I want to make sure we have the best people on our teams.

I’ve decided to raise the bar on performance management and move out low performers faster. We typically manage out people who aren’t meeting expectations over the course of a year, but now we’re going to do more extensive performance-based cuts during this cycle, with the intention of back filling these roles in 2025. We won’t manage out everyone who didn’t meet expectations for the last period if we’re optimistic about their future performance, and for those we do let go, we’ll provide generous severance in line with what we provided with previous cuts. 

We’ll follow up with more guidance for managers ahead of calibrations. People who are impacted will be notified on February 10 or later for those outside the U.S.""

Stocks,China Discusses Sale of TikTok US to Musk as One Possible Option,"Bloomberg: Chinese officials are evaluating a potential option that involves Elon Musk acquiring the US operations of TikTok if the company fails to fend off a controversial ban on the short-video app, according to people familiar with the matter.

Beijing officials strongly prefer that TikTok remains under the ownership of parent ByteDance Ltd., the people say, and the company is contesting the impending ban with an appeal to the US Supreme Court. But the justices signaled during arguments on Jan. 10 that they are likely to uphold the law. Senior Chinese officials had already begun to debate contingency plans for TikTok as part of an expansive discussion on how to work with Donald Trump’s administration, one of which involves Musk, said the people, asking not to be identified revealing confidential discussions.

A potential high-profile deal with one of Trump’s closest allies holds some appeal for the Chinese government, which is expected to have some say over whether TikTok is ultimately sold, said the people. Musk spent more than $250 million supporting Trump’s re-election, and has been tapped for a prominent role in improving government efficiency after the Republican takes office.

Under one scenario that’s been discussed by the Chinese government, Musk’s X — the former Twitter — would take control of TikTok US and run the businesses together, the people said. With more than 170 million users in the US, TikTok could bolster X’s efforts to attract advertisers. Musk also founded a separate artificial intelligence company, xAI, that could benefit from the huge amounts of data generated from TikTok.

Chinese officials have yet to reach any firm consensus about how to proceed and their deliberations are still preliminary, the people said. It’s not clear how much ByteDance knows about the Chinese government discussions or whether TikTok and Musk have been involved. It’s also unclear whether Musk, TikTok and ByteDance have held any talks about the terms of any possible deal.

Musk and his representatives did not respond to a request for comment. Musk posted in April that he thinks TikTok should remain available in the US. “In my opinion, TikTok should not be banned in the USA, even though such a ban may benefit the X platform,” he wrote on X. “Doing so would be contrary to freedom of speech and expression. It is not what America stands for.”

ByteDance and TikTok representatives didn’t respond to messages seeking comment. The Cyberspace Administration of China and China’s Ministry of Commerce, government agencies that could be involved in decisions about TikTok’s future, also didn’t respond to requests for comment.

The talks in Beijing suggest that TikTok’s fate may no longer be in ByteDance’s sole control, said the people. Chinese officials recognize they will face tough negotiations with the Trump administration over tariffs, export controls and other issues, and they see the TikTok negotiations as a potential area for reconciliation, they said.

The Chinese government holds a so-called golden share in a ByteDance affiliate that gives it influence over the company’s strategy and operations. TikTok maintains that the control only applies to the China-based subsidiary Douyin Information Service Co., and has no bearing on ByteDance operations outside China. Still, Beijing’s export rules prevent Chinese companies from selling their software algorithms, like the one integral to TikTok. Because the Chinese government would have to approve of a sale that includes TikTok’s valuable recommendation engine, it has a significant voice in any possible deal.

TikTok’s US operations could be valued at around $40 billion to $50 billion, Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Mandeep Singh and Damian Reimertz estimated last year. That’s a substantial sum even for the world’s richest person. It’s not clear how Musk could pull off such a transaction, whether it would require the sale of other holdings, or whether the US government would approve. He paid $44 billion for Twitter in 2022, and is still paying off sizable loans.

Musk has a positive reputation among many ByteDance employees in China, according to a person familiar with the matter. He is seen as a very successful entrepreneur, who has experience engaging with the Chinese government through his Tesla Inc. business, the person added.

ByteDance’s leaders have repeatedly said their priority is to fight US legislation that requires the Beijing-based company sell or shut down the US operations because of national security concerns. TikTok’s lawyers have argued the legislation violates free speech laws under the Constitution’s First Amendment.

A majority of the Supreme Court justices suggested the security concerns take priority over free speech, although they have yet to issue a formal decision. President-elect Trump, who takes office Jan. 20, has sought to delay the TikTok ban — which takes effect Jan. 19 — so he can work on the negotiations. He has said he wants to “save” the app and there’s been speculation he could take last-minute action to sidestep the ban.

On a practical level, spinning off TikTok’s US business would be highly complex, affecting shareholders in China as well as the US. Lawyers for TikTok argued before the Supreme Court that separating the US portions of the product would be “extraordinarily difficult.”

It’s unclear if US TikTok would be sold off in a competitive process, or if a sale would be arranged by the government. Billionaire Frank McCourt and “Shark Tank” investor Kevin O’Leary are part of a bid through Project Liberty to acquire TikTok, which O’Leary has said he discussed with Trump. In the past, Microsoft Corp. had sought to acquire the business, and Oracle Corp. has a deep technology partnership with the company.

One alternative for TikTok would be to move its existing US customers over to a similar app — with different branding — to potentially sidestep the ban, one of the people said. It’s not clear how effective such a move would be.

One person close to the company, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the strategy, said before the Supreme Court hearing that the legal battle is still the focus of top executives and they would prefer to keep fighting in the US rather than sell TikTok US and cede control for good.

Musk is in a position to influence the China-US relationship as the world’s richest person with businesses that straddle the world’s two largest economies. Tesla, where Musk is chief executive officer, erected a sprawling factory in Shanghai in 2019 and has since expanded the facility into the company’s largest production base. The effort helped Tesla expand its market share in China despite tough local competition, and build goodwill with government officials.

While Trump is staffing his incoming administration with China hawks like Secretary of State nominee Marco Rubio, Musk has spoken out against some recent China trade policies, including the Biden administration’s tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles.

**Thoughts:** Obviously this type of news has the ability to move TSLA/META/social networks. We've seen TSLA make moves from political news, SpaceX news, Twitter news, and TSLA trades as a proxy to whatever Elon Musk is doing at the time even if it's not directly applicable to TSLA as a company. 

Very low probability of it happening but interesting to brainstorm trading ideas.

Stocks,S&P’s $18 Trillion Rally Threatened by Psychology of 5% Yields,">For years it’s seemed like nothing could stop the stock market’s inexorable march higher, as the S&P 500 Index soared more than 50% from the start of 2023 to the end of 2024, adding $18 trillion in value in the process. Now, however, Wall Street is seeing what can ultimately derail this rally: Treasury yields above 5%.

>Equities traders have shrugged off the bond market’s warnings for months, focusing instead on the windfall from President-elect Donald Trump’s promised tax cuts and the seemingly limitless possibilities of artificial intelligence. But the risk came into focus last week as Treasury yields climbed toward their ominous milestones and share prices sank in response.

>The yield on 20-year US Treasuries breached 5% on Wednesday and jumped back above on Friday, reaching the highest since Nov. 2, 2023. Meanwhile, 30-year US Treasuries briefly crossed 5% on Friday to the highest since Oct. 31, 2023. Those yields have risen roughly 100 basis points since mid-September, when the Federal Reserve started reducing the fed funds rate, which has come down 100 basis points over the same time.

>“It is unusual,” Jeff Blazek, co-CIO of multi-asset strategies at Neuberger Berman, said of the dramatic and rapid jump in bond yields in the early months of an easing cycle. Over the past 30 years, intermediate and longer-term yields have been relatively flat or modestly higher in the months after the Fed initiated a string of rate cuts, he added.

>Traders are watching the policy-sensitive 10-year Treasury yield, which is the highest it’s been since October 2023 and is rapidly approaching 5%, a level they fear could spark a stock market correction. It last passed the threshold briefly in October 2023, and before that you have to go back to July 2007.

>“If the 10-year hits 5% there will be a knee-jerk reaction to sell stocks,” said Matt Peron, Janus Henderson’s global head of solutions. “Episodes like this take weeks or maybe a few months to play out, and over the course of that the S&P 500 could get to down 10%.”

>The reason is fairly simple. Rising bond yields make returns on Treasuries more attractive, while also increasing the cost of raising capital for companies.

>The spillover into the stock market was apparent on Friday, as the S&P 500 tumbled 1.5% for its worst day since mid-December, turned negative for 2025, and came close to wiping out all the gains from the November euphoria sparked by Trump’s election.

>While there’s “no magic” to the fixation on 5% beyond round-number psychology, perceived barriers can create “technical barriers,” said Kristy Akullian, Blackrock’s head of iShares investment strategy. Meaning, a swift move in yields can make it difficult for stocks to rise.

>Investors are already seeing how. The earnings yield for the S&P 500 is sitting 1 percentage point below what’s offered by 10-year Treasuries, a development last seen in 2002. In other words, the return on owning a significantly less risky asset than the US equities benchmark hasn’t been this good in a long time.

>“Once yields get higher it becomes harder and harder to rationalize valuation levels,” said Mike Reynolds, vice president of investment strategy at Glenmede Trust. “And if earnings growth starts to falter, there can be issues.”

>Not surprisingly, strategists and portfolio managers predict a bumpy road ahead for stocks. Morgan Stanley’s Mike Wilson anticipates a tough six months for equities, while Citigroup’s wealth division told clients there’s a buying opportunity in bonds.

>The path to 5% on the 10-year Treasury became more realistic on Friday after strong jobs data caused economists to reduce expectations for rate cuts this year. But this isn’t just about the Fed. The selloff in bonds is global and based on sticky inflation, hawkish central banks, ballooning government debts, and extreme uncertainties presented by the incoming Trump administration.

>“When you’re in hostile waters, yields above 5% is where all bets are off,” Mark Malek, chief investment officer at Siebert, said.

>What equity investors need to know now is if, and when, serious buyers step in.

>“The real question is where we go from there,” said Rick de los Reyes, a portfolio manager at T. Rowe Price. “If it’s 5% on its way to 6% then that’s going to get people concerned, if it’s 5% before stabilizing and ultimately going lower then things will be fine.”

>Red Flags

>The key isn’t so much that yields are rising, but why, market pros say. A slow increase as the US economy improves can help stocks. But a quick jump due to concerns about inflation, the federal deficit and policy uncertainty is a red flag.

>In recent years, whenever yields have risen quickly, stocks have sold off. The difference this time appears to be complacent investors, as seen in bullish positioning in the face of frothy valuations and uncertainties about Trump’s policies. And that’s putting equities in a vulnerable position.

>“When you look at rising prices, a strong job market and an overall strong economy, it all points to a possible uptick in inflation,” said Eric Diton, president of the Wealth Alliance. “And that’s not even including Trump’s policies.”

>One area that may prove to be a haven for equity investors is the group that’s been driving most of the gains these past few years: Big Tech. The so-called Magnificent Seven companies — Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Apple Inc., Meta Platforms Inc., Microsoft Corp., Nvidia Corp. and Tesla Inc. — are still posting rapid earnings growth and massive cash flows. Plus, looking to the future, they’re expected to be the biggest beneficiaries of the artificial intelligence revolution.

>“Investors typically seek high quality stocks with strong balance sheets and strong cash flows during market turmoil,” said Eric Sterner, chief investment officer at Apollon Wealth. “The mega techs have become part of that defensive play recently.”

>That’s the hope many equity investors are hanging on, that mega-cap tech companies’ sway over the broader market and their relative security will limit any weakness in the stock market. The Magnificent Seven have a more than 30% weighting in the S&P 500.

>At the same time, the Fed is in the midst of lowering interest rates, although the pace is likely going to be slower than expected. That makes this a very different situation than 2022, when the Fed was hiking rates rapidly and indexes plunged.

>Still, many Wall Street pros are urging investors to proceed cautiously for the time being as rate risk hits in various unexpected ways.

>“The companies in the S&P 500 that are up the most will probably be the most vulnerable — and that could include the Mag Seven — and some frothy areas of mid-cap and small-cap growth will likely be under pressure,” said Janus Henderson’s Peron. “We’ve been consistent across our firm on staying focused on quality and being valuation sensitive. That will be very important in the coming months.”

Stocks,Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg trash talks Apple in interview,"https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/10/24341039/meta-apple-mark-zuckerberg-trash-talks-joe-rogan-interview

> Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg thinks Apple “[hasn’t] really invented anything great in a while” and that it has been coasting off of its past success. “Steve Jobs invented the iPhone and now they’re just kind of sitting on it 20 years later,” he said this week. Zuckerberg made the statements during a nearly three-hour long podcast with Joe Rogan where, along with discussing Meta’s moderation policy changes and turn against diversity and inclusion policies, they got into Meta’s beef with Apple and its policies.

> The conversation actually started with Rogan’s issues with Apple. Rogan said he’s moving “from Apple to Android” in part because he doesn’t “like being attached to one company.” He also isn’t a fan of Apple’s App Store policies. “The way they do that Apple store, where they charge people 30 percent,” he said. “That seems so insane that they can get away with doing that.” “I have some opinions about this,” Zuckerberg said. While he gives credit to the iPhone as “obviously one of the most important inventions probably of all time,” he argued that Apple has put rules in place that “feel arbitrary.” Zuckerberg said that Apple has “thoroughly hamstrung the ability for anyone else to build something that can connect to the iPhone in the same way” as Apple’s own products, like the AirPods. If Apple let other people use its protocol, “there would probably be much better competitors to AirPods out there,” Zuckerberg said.

> Down the line, Zuckerberg envisions a world where you’ll be able to use the neural interface wristband and the glasses to text a friend or an AI and have the glasses give you the answer. He also believes that as smart glasses or even contact lenses as a computing platform become more developed, the internet will be “overlaid” on the physical world. “I think we’ll basically be in this wild world where most of the world will be physical, but there will be this increasing amount of virtual objects or people who are beaming in or hologramming into different things to interact in different ways,” he said. “There isn’t a physical world and a digital world anymore,” he added. “We’re in 2025. It’s one world.”","['META', 'AAPL', 'META', 'AAPL', 'META', 'META', 'AAPL', 'AAPL', 'AAPL', 'AAPL', 'AAPL', 'AAPL', 'AAPL', 'AAPL', 'AAPL']",923,468,324,2025-01-11 16:59:32+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1hz09io/meta_ceo_mark_zuckerberg_trash_talks_apple_in/,0.8842

Stocks,"Apple's market share slides in China as iPhone shipments decline, analyst Kuo says","Apple is losing market share in China due to declining iPhone shipments, supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo wrote in a report on Friday. The stock slid 2.4%.

“Apple has adopted a cautious stance when discussing 2025 iPhone production plans with key suppliers,” Kuo, an analyst at TF Securities, wrote in the post. He added that despite the expected launch of the new iPhone SE 4, shipments are expected to decline 6% year over year for the first half of 2025.

Kuo expects Apple’s market share to continue to slide, as two of the coming iPhones are so thin that they likely will only support eSIM, which the Chinese market currently does not promote.

“These two models could face shipping momentum challenges unless their design is modified,” he wrote.

Kuo wrote that in December, overall smartphone shipments in China were flat from a year earlier, but iPhone shipments dropped 10% to 12%.

There is also “no evidence” that Apple Intelligence, the company’s on-device artificial intelligence offering, is driving hardware upgrades or services revenue, according to Kuo. He wrote that the feature “has not boosted iPhone replacement demand,” according to a supply chain survey he conducted, and added that in his view, the feature’s appeal “has significantly declined compared to cloud-based AI services, which have advanced rapidly in subsequent months.”

Apple’s estimated iPhone shipments total about 220 million units for 2024 and between about 220 million and 225 million for this year, Kuo wrote. That is “below the market consensus of 240 million or more,” he wrote.

Stocks,PSA: just because a stock dips doesn't mean it's on sale. ,"That is, just because a stock is now lower in price than it was a week, month, or year ago doesn't mean it's a good buy today. 

I see this mistake on here constantly, especially in recent years as more casual investors have entered into the stock market. When it comes to indexes, celebrate the dip and buy, absolutely.

*It's a guaranteed recovery as long as a world war doesn't break out and destroy America (we Canadians are ready to check off more of the Geneva checklist if you Yanks try anything funny).* /s 

But for individual stocks? No. The story is different. AI may or may not be a bubble, but it's objectively true that some companies have profited greatly off of their AI investments while others have only made performative moves and have yet to see any real profit.

Quantum computing is another hot area worth mentioning. So many people are tempted to chase what is an obvious bubble. As Jensen Huang said, we aren't even close. It's just gambling at this point, even if a 40% dip makes you feel like you have a ""margin of safety."" 

People have gotten used to infinite V movements. There was a guy in the daily thread for months pointing out how every dip was immediately bought back up. This is not always the case, as we're seeing now. There's no guarantee that a stock will return to ATHs, even if it's one of our beloved bluechips. 

But just because something is now lower in price does not make it ""on sale."" If a banana used to be $100 and is now $50, would you buy it? No! That's still an outrageous price. Find some 10 cent kiwis instead. 

Obligatory AMD comment: yes it was $200. No that price likely wasn't justified. I can't say whether the current price is good or bad, but with a narrow moat and poor performance in a historical semi/data centre run, it's been disappointing. It could absolutely skyrocket again, but that is not promised to you. For many, it is only now approaching a fair value, and for others it needs to dip below 100 or even less to reach that point. Despite being almost 50% from its ATH, it may still just be a $50 banana! 

Anyway, I hope this saves some of you from buying bad companies just because they are down. Be careful out there!

Stocks,"Contrarian alert: Uber’s missing the AI wave, yet it looks promising.","So, after Travis Kalanick got ousted, Dara Khosrowshahi stepped in and turned Uber from a “wartime” to a “peacetime” company. He cleaned up the culture mess, shoved aside long-term moonshots (like Uber’s self-driving unit) and put the company on a strict path to profitability (as expected from a former Wall Street banker).

Despite getting smacked by COVID and high interest rates, Uber tightened its belt, doubled down on demand-supply matchmaking, and came out profitable. Wall Street went nuts. Uber is now FCF-positive and aiming for even higher margins. 

**So what is Uber today?**

Dara says they’re laser-focused on nailing that perfect supply-demand match. Sure, they’re winning in mobility and they might tackle new verticals like Fiverr-style marketplaces. Sounds great, except they’re missing out on the biggest opportunity of our era, which is motherfucking **AI.**

Uber collects **11B trips** a year from **160M users**, racking up insane amounts of data (driver reviews, food reviews, social patterns across countless cities etc). This could’ve made them a self-driving powerhouse. But they ditched their autonomous unit in 2020 to cut costs, just as NVIDIA’s Jensen Huang now shows off new automotive processors and partnerships with Toyota, Aurora (who bought Uber’s AV unit), and Volvo. **Uber’s name is nowhere on that list!!!**

No matter how you spin it, a simple “supply-demand” marketplace could get overshadowed once autonomous vehicles go mainstream. Especially when you already own the infrastructure for ride-hailing, food delivery, scooters and bikes.

**Investors might be licking their chops (at least I would do it If I were them)** at two big plays:

1. **Pull a Reddit:** Sell anonymized data for LLM training and get lots of money, further increasing margins. Instantly, Uber gets an “AI play.” 
2. **Sell to Tesla or Google:** Supercharge someone else’s AV ambitions (as well as their foundation models) and get a fat premium in the process.

Meanwhile, the stock still looks undervalued. Uber’s **LTM P/FCF** is around **22.6x**, PEG is **under 1.0x** (Peter Lynch territory), and a Reverse DCF suggests they only need **9.2% revenue growth** (at \~12.4% margins) over 10 years to justify the current price. That’s totally doable.

Here’s how I see it playing out:

1. **Best case:** Tesla or Google acquires them this year and we get a solid premium payday. Probably a stock deal, but it’s still peanuts compared to Tesla and Google market caps. 
2. **Second best:** Uber pivots to selling AI training data. 
3. **Not bad either:** Uber dominates more human-driven marketplaces. 
4. **Base scenario:** They stick to mobility, keep expanding margins, and *maybe* bolt on third-party AVs .

The MSCI EM stock index dropped 0.4% and registered a 10% loss since an Oct. 2 high, marking a correction. The slide was led by Samsung Electronics Co.

Heavily weighted by China equities, the index has suffered from steep losses in shares from the world’s second-largest economy as the government’s stimulus package fell short of investor expectations.

Stocks,Amazon to Let Retailers Use Its Ad Tools on Their Own Stores,">Amazon has turned into an online ad juggernaut in recent years, with brands paying big bucks for premium placement on the retailer’s websites. Now, Amazon is letting other sites use its ad technology for their own stores.

>The new offering, called Amazon Retail Ad Service, allows companies to show “contextually relevant ads in the right place and at the right time” in search results, product pages and other areas of their site, Amazon said Thursday.

>It’s initially available for U.S. retailers, which will pay fees based on usage levels. Prices weren’t disclosed.

>Amazon in 2022 began breaking out ad revenue in its quarterly earnings reports, showing that the business had become a significant contributor to the company’s top and bottom lines. Ad revenue in the latest quarter came in at $14.3 billion, third to Alphabet and Meta in digital advertising.

>That’s still much less than the sales Amazon generates from online stores and cloud computing, which came to $61.4 billion and $27.4 billion, respectively, in the quarter that ended in October.

>The bulk of Amazon’s ad revenue comes from sponsored product advertisements, which are keyword-targeted ads that let brands promote certain items. Amazon has stuffed more of these sponsored items into search results and product pages over time. It also generates some ad revenue through streaming.

>With Amazon Retail Ad Service, users will be able to customize the design, placement and number of ads shown across their sites, as well as use Amazon’s ad measurement and reporting tools.

>The service could provide Amazon with valuable data it can use to bolster its ad prediction and recommendation technology. The company said early customers include health and wellness retailer iHerb, Asian grocery startup Weee! and Oriental Trading Co., which sells toys, party and craft supplies.

>“We’ve designed this to be a win for retailers, advertisers, and shoppers, and we look forward to seeing how it improves outcomes, drives sales and enhances the shopping experience,” said Paula Despins, vice president of Amazon Ads Measurement, in the press release.

>The announcement comes a few days before the National Retail Federation’s annual trade show.

>It’s not the first time Amazon has sold its in-house technology and services to third parties.

>Amazon Web Services began as cloud infrastructure to support its online retail business. The company launched AWS as a business in 2006. In 2022, the company launched Buy With Prime, which combines Amazon’s payment and fulfillment services for other retailers.

Stocks,Medline IPO - The ‘Amazon of Healthcare’,"Medline, LP has recently announced that they have confidentially filed a draft S-1 with rumored plans to IPO in Q2 of 2025. If you aren’t from a healthcare background, you probably haven’t heard of Medline. If you are, you know their products are practically ubiquitous in any healthcare setting. Founded in 1966, they are currently the largest privately held manufacturer and distributor of healthcare supplies in the US, with over 550,000 SKUs and 23.2B of revenue in 2023. Several years back numerous PEs purchased 75% of the company from the Mills Family who owned the company for 34B, with the Mills retaining the other quarter. It’s now looking at an IPO valuation of about 50B.

I’m a Home Health Physical Therapist and I see their products in about 90% of homes that I arrive to.

Stocks,Disney says about 157 million global users are streaming content with ads,"Disney said Wednesday it has an estimated 157 million global monthly active users watching ad-supported content across its streaming platforms — Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+.

That number includes 112 million users domestically and is an average per month over the last six months.

While traditional TV outlets have a standard way of measuring ratings and viewership, there is still no industry standard methodology for measuring global streaming advertising audience size.

The company said that its Disney Advertising unit has “set out to define a globally consistent approach and methodology to estimate ad-supported audience numbers.” It’s providing the update and further insight into its ad-supported streaming business during the annual CES tech conference in Las Vegas, a go-to event for the advertising and media industry.

“Disney sits at the intersection of world class sports and entertainment content, with the most high-value audiences in ad-supported global streaming at scale,” said Rita Ferro, Disney’s president of global advertising, in a news release. “We wanted to be the first to offer our industry greater transparency into the methodology used to estimate our engaged global ad-supported monthly active users.”

In explaining the methodology, the company said the metric is derived from active accounts across Disney’s three streaming services that have viewed ad-supported shows and movies continuously for more than 10 seconds. “Each active account is then multiplied by the number of estimated users per account ... to estimate the total number of users,” it said. The estimated active users are added across the apps without de-duplication, meaning users who subscribe to more than one of the platforms could be counted more than once.

Growth in ad-supported tiers

Media companies have become particularly focused on generating profits from their streaming businesses, and advertising has become a key way to do that. While many platforms were initially subscription services without commercials, streaming platforms in recent years have introduced cheaper, ad-supported tiers for consumers.

Disney CEO Bob Iger has said that the company is trying to steer its customers toward its ad-supported tiers. The company has raised prices on commercial-free options since launching Disney+ with ads in late 2022.

Disney’s Hulu was one of the first streaming platforms to offer an ad-supported option. More recently, Disney+ introduced an ad-supported tier.

In November, Disney said it had 122.7 million Disney+ Core subscribers, which excludes Disney+ Hotstar in India and other countries in the region. Hulu had 52 million subscribers, while ESPN+ had 25.6 million paid subscribers.

The company historically hasn’t reported exactly how many subscribers on each platform pay for the ad-supported option, but executives in the earnings call in November said more than half of new U.S. Disney+ subscribers were choosing the cheaper, ad-supported tier, adding this “bodes well for the future.”

Disney noted during the call that average revenue per user for domestic Disney+ customers dropped from $7.74 to $7.70, due to a higher mix of customers on its cheaper, ad-supported tier and wholesale offerings. 

Executives also said in November that they were confident streaming would “be a significant growth area” for the company.

At the time, the company reported that its combined streaming business, which includes Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+, posted operating income of $321 million for the September period compared with a loss of $387 million during the same period the year prior.

Disney will report its fiscal first-quarter earnings on Feb. 5 before the bell.

Stocks,Microsoft confirms performance-based job cuts across departments,"Microsoft is cutting a small percentage of jobs across departments, based on performance, the company confirmed to CNBC on Wednesday.

“At Microsoft we focus on high-performance talent,” a Microsoft spokesperson said in an email to CNBC on Wednesday. “We are always working on helping people learn and grow. When people are not performing, we take the appropriate action.”

Business Insider reported on the plans late Tuesday.

The job cuts will affect less than 1% of employees, said a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be named in order to discuss private information.

Microsoft had 228,000 employees at the end of June. While the company’s net income margin of nearly 38% is close to its highest since the early 2000s, Microsoft’s stock underperformed its peers last year, rising 12% while the Nasdaq gained 29%.

Microsoft’s latest cuts are slim compared to recent downsizing efforts.

In early 2023, the company laid off 10,000 employees and consolidated leases. In January 2024, three months after completing the $75.4 billion Activision Blizzard acquisition, Microsoft’s gaming unit shed 1,900 jobs to reduce overlap.

As 2025 begins, Microsoft faces a more tenuous relationship with artificial intelligence startup OpenAI, which the company has backed to the tune of over $13 billion. The partnership helped propel Microsoft’s market cap past $3 trillion last year.

Over the summer, Microsoft added OpenAI to its list of competitors. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella used the phrase “cooperation tension” while discussing the relationship with investors Brad Gerstner and Bill Gurley on a podcast released last month.

Meanwhile, the Microsoft 365 Copilot assistant, which draws on OpenAI technology, has yet to become pervasive in business. Analysts at UBS said in a note last month that they came away from Microsoft’s Ignite conference with the impression that Copilot rollouts “have been a bit slow/underwhelming.”

Microsoft is still touting its growth opportunities. Finance chief Amy Hood said in October that revenue growth from Microsoft’s Azure cloud will speed up in the first half of this year because of greater AI infrastructure capacity.

Stocks,Biden to Further Limit Nvidia AI Chip Exports in Final,"President Joe Biden’s administration plans one additional round of restrictions on the export of artificial intelligence chips from the likes of Nvidia Corp. just days before leaving office, a final push in his effort to keep advanced technologies out of the hands of China and Russia.

The US wants to curb the sale of AI chips used in data centers on both a country and company basis, with the goal of concentrating AI development in friendly nations and getting businesses around the world to align with American standards, according to people familiar with the matter.

Stocks,I am going long on Human greed.,"TLDR:
Tech giants are throwing billions into AI datacenters, these centers require a LOT of energy.  
Current administration restricted fossil fuels in order to reduce carbon emissions.  New administration plans to remove restrictions.  Fossil fuels are more cost effective than nuclear energy so I invested in a large American oil/gas supplier which recently pivoted to supply power to these datacenters on the premise that politicians will choose the option that makes more money over saving the environment.  


Large companies are throwing around insane numbers to invest in AI datacenters (Microsoft plans to spend $80B in 2025, Amazon spent $11B and every other tech giant has shown or already enacted similar plans).

Biden administration heavily regulated and restricted fossil fuels and provided grants to nuclear energy companies.  

The incoming Trump administration has been clear that they plan to overturn these restrictions and return to fossil fuels.  Multiple major U.S oil and gas suppliers such as Chevron and Exxon Mobil announced in December that they plan to pivot and provide power to AI datacenters.

I am not confident about my ability to predict the next major AI company but I am confident that these centers will need power, and a lot of it.  

Location will be incredibly important as suppliers closest to the centers will have the advantage.  Existing American oil/gas suppliers that extend across the U.S and can meet increased demand seem to be ideal qualities.","['MSFT', 'AMZN']",0,42,20,2025-01-08 20:18:51+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1hwttc6/i_am_going_long_on_human_greed/,0.8813
Stocks,"US analysts list Teva, Wix in 2025 top picks","Full article: https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-us-analysts-list-teva-wix-in-2025-top-picks-1001498940

Two Israeli companies, Teva Pharmaceuticals and Wix.com, have been selected as top picks for 2025 by leading US analysts.

Bank of America included Teva in its biopharma survey, highlighting the company’s strong performance and potential for continued growth. Teva, which is led by CEO Richard Francis, saw its stock rise by 111% in 2024 and now has a market cap of $24.6 billion. Bank of America raised its price target for Teva shares from $25 to $26, citing positive financial results, plans to sell its active ingredients division, and significant debt reduction efforts. Additionally, the success of duvakitug, a drug for inflammatory bowel disease co-developed with Sanofi, boosted investor confidence after strong Phase 2 trial results. Analysts believe Teva's strong product pipeline and turnaround strategy leave room for further price increases.

In the Internet sector, Cantor Fitzgerald selected Wix.com as a top pick alongside major players like Meta, Amazon, and DoorDash. Wix, under the leadership of CEO Avishai Abrahami, saw its stock rise by 74% in 2024, bringing its market cap to $12.1 billion. Cantor Fitzgerald raised its price target for Wix shares from $240 to $260, emphasizing the company's robust roadmap, pricing strength, and new AI product launches. Analysts believe these factors will drive growth and expand Wix’s trading multiples. Furthermore, Wix is seen as a potential acquisition target, adding to its attractiveness for investors. 

Both companies have demonstrated significant momentum and are positioned for further success in 2025, driven by innovation and strategic initiatives.","['META', 'AMZN']",0,0,0,2025-01-08 16:58:29+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1hwoxed/us_analysts_list_teva_wix_in_2025_top_picks/,0.9951

Tariffs. America first. INTC is going up.

Intel is splitting and focusing on foundry orders, potentially benefiting from companies like Nvidia? INTC is going up.

# Welcome to the face-meltingly fast world of M&A trading.

**News:** At 3:16 ET on 1/06/2025, NARI spiked to the upper ($47.25 -> $52.66) on news that Stryker (SYK) was reportedly in the final stages of negotiations to acquire Inari Medical, a company that produces devices for the treatment of venous diseases. This was posted on Monday by Reuters.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**There's a decent amount to unpack here:**

\- Strong reaction to news with an immediate move to upper for NARI, but no real reaction in SYK.  
\- ""Final stages of negotiations to acquire Inari Medical"". Note that it says final stages- this isn't random speculation that moves a stock 1 or 2 percent, this is actual news that an acquisition bid is happening.  
\- Reuters is a reputable news source (compared to hearing this from some rando on Twitter), they wouldn't post this unless there was high confirmation.  
\- Medical device acquisitions typically don't have high chance of being broken up by the FTC- last one I vaguely remember was Boston Scientific (BSX) back in 2022 acquiring some South Korean company being broken up.

Both companies involved are fairly large, NARI had a roughly $3B market cap before this news broke. It takes a lot of money to meaningfully move the price for a company this large. SYK didn't move.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**While the stock is halted, it becomes a game of:**

\- ""What price will NARI unhalt at?"" and  
\- ""What is likely to be the acquisition price for NARI?""

**From here, you can intuit some measure of EV (expected value) if know the right questions to ask:**

\- Is there meaningful value in shorting SYK (because it hasn't moved) if the rumors are true?  
\- Is that EV from shorting SYK better than buying NARI?  
\- What is the EV of buying NARI? We're already up 10%!

**When you see a stock move like this, how much more will it move?**

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The Speed Trade:

**Executing:** Realistically, two places to make the ""speed"" trade- initial ""rumor"" news release (3:16 ET), and the actual announcement of the deal (4:08 ET)

**Infra:** I'm assuming that this broke on Reuters Eikon (which is their equivalent to Bloomberg Terminal), but likely that Bloomberg users were able to capture this as well.

**EV:** Best EV since you'll get it close to flat and can bail on the trade if we reach pre-news prices again. In theory, your EV is 0 in the worst case scenario and ludicrously best in the best case.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The Unhalt Trade (The EV Trade):

**Executing:** You would be able to look at the unhalt price (which is what the stock will open at) and determine whether or not you're still willing to be a buyer at \~$58. At unhalt, that's roughly 22% premium in acquisition, and remember that these are still *rumors (despite being in final stages).*

**Thought Process:** Ultimately, you'd have a price point in your mind that you think the market would value this stock at. You also determine the probability the market thinks the deal will go through, then multiply that to get a *very rough guess* of what the stock will trade at. Personally, I didn't know this, but ChatGPT cited 20-40% premium on acquisition purchases of medical device companies. So we have a theoretical range of $57-$66.50 (reduced by multiplying whatever percentage of success you think the deal will go through).

The market was pricing something FAR above that 20%- within the next 10 minutes we go up to $63, then trade around a range of $61 to $65, so fairly within expectations despite all the uncertainty. Ultimately the best case scenario for this type of trade is buying at unhalt (\~$58 and selling within $61-$65).

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The End.... or is it?

Overall, that would've been the extent of what most traders- but after the market closed, [SYK announced that they were actually going to acquire NARI for $80/share in cash at 4:08 PM. ](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/01/06/3004972/0/en/Stryker-announces-definitive-agreement-to-acquire-Inari-Medical-Inc-providing-entry-into-high-growth-peripheral-vascular-segment.html)That blows all the ""theoretical"" range in the EV trade out of the water- we have a ***hard defined*** EV we can base our trades around- and the **speed trade is back on. So the stock spiked from $65.84 to $83, then settles at $78.**

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The Arbitrage Trade (likely just old offers and sloppy executions):

Notice how I said that the stock spiked to $83 despite the deal price being $80? That's a classic example of a market inefficiency.

Remember that this news was released at 4:08 PM, so it's afterhours- liquidity is far more sparse and market making algos are not as active because there are less participants.

Some traders were probably too slow to getting their buy orders in upon seeing the news or they blasted the offer without looking at remaining liquidity, so they bought at prices ABOVE $80, what SYK was willing to pay.

If you were a superhuman trader you'd be able to short at prices above $80, but it was more likely that these were old offers that weren't adjusted by human traders or market makers, and got extremely lucky.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The M&A Trade:

**Executing/Thought Process:** Not much to speak of here, we went to roughly $78 after SYK formally announced they were acquiring, so there's less than a 2.5% potential gain in an unknown timeframe. Overall not worth it. You COULD short some SYK after the deal announcement (a 68% acquisition premium may be viewed negatively by the market).

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Takeaways:

* **If a stock reacts this quickly to a rumor, likely that the company will release follow-up news to dispel or confirm it shortly after.** If you were able to get the speed trade or even good prints on the EV trade, it was worth keeping *a little* if you were wary of holding your entire position. This was made more difficult because the rumor was formally confirmed afterhours, so most people likely would have pared a significant amount of their position.
* **Extremely important to keep a ""Expected Value"" of the trade in your head in times of ambiguity**. If you had a decent mental framework of how these M&A deals worked (and could reference the premium of medical device companies), it could have influenced your trading coming out of the unhalt.
* The best EV is speed. (self-explanatory)

Stocks,Nvidia CEO Unveils Gaming ‘Blackwell’ Cards and Project DIGITS AI Supercomputer,"https://www.barrons.com/articles/nvidia-ces-2025-blackwell-gaming-17697a0e

Despite the focus on the company’s AI data center products the past year, the chip maker is still releasing its latest processor technologies to boost the PC gaming experiences for consumers.

On Monday, Nvidia unveiled its next generation gaming graphic cards at the CES tech trade show in Las Vegas. The company’s CEO, Jensen Huang, announced the coming RTX 5090 card and three other models, all of which will use “Blackwell” architecture chips.

“Blackwell, the engine of AI, has arrived for PC gamers,” Huang said.

The RTX 5090 will sell for $1,999, while the 5080, 5070 Ti, and 5070 will cost $999, $749, and $549, respectively. The 5090 and 5080 will be available on Jan. 30, while the other cards will be available starting in February.

The RTX 50 Series cards will also support Nvidia’s fourth generation DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) technology, which boosts performance by rendering images at lower resolutions and then using artificial intelligence to reconstruct details at higher resolutions. A Nvidia executive says DLSS 4.0 uses the latest AI transformer models to improve image quality.

Nvidia says the RTX 5090 will outperform the prior generation’s RTX 4090 by up to two times when using DLSS 4.0.

Huang also announced an AI desktop computer named Project DIGITS, which runs a Linux-based operating system and incorporates a GB10 Blackwell Superchip that can deliver up to 1 petaflop of AI performance.

“Placing an AI supercomputer on the desks of every data scientist, AI researcher and student empowers them to engage and shape the age of AI,” Huang said.

Project DIGITS will be available in May, starting at $3,000.

Stocks,"Meta scraps fact checking program, is bringing back political content","https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/07/meta-eliminates-third-party-fact-checking-moves-to-community-notes.html

Meta on Tuesday announced it will eliminate its third-party fact checking program to “restore free expression” and move to a “Community Notes” model, similar to the system that exists on Elon Musk’s platform X.

The company said Community Notes will be written and rated by contributing users to provide more context to posts across its platforms, and the feature will roll out in the U.S. over the next couple of months. The announcement marks Meta’s latest attempt to smooth over relations with Republican President-elect Donald Trump before he takes office.

“We’ve reached a point where it’s just too many mistakes, and too much censorship,” Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Tuesday in a video announcement. “The recent elections also feel like a cultural tipping point towards once again prioritizing speech, so we’re going to get back to our roots and focus on reducing mistakes, simplifying our polices and restoring free expression on our platforms.”

Zuckerberg said the third-party fact checkers have been “too politically biased” and have “destroyed more trust than they’ve created, especially in the U.S.”

Meta said it will simplify its content policies by removing restrictions on subjects like immigration and gender and implement a new approach to policy enforcement that will focus on illegal and high severity violations. The company is moving its trust and safety and content moderation teams from California, a historically Democratic state, to Texas, a historically Republican state.

“We’re going to work with President Trump to push back on governments around the world that are going after American companies and pushing to censor more,” Zuckerberg said.

Joel Kaplan, Meta’s head of global policy, appeared on “Fox and Friends” Tuesday and said Meta thinks the Community Notes system on Musk’s platform X has been working “really well.” Musk, who has been a vocal advocate for Trump online and donated millions of dollars to his campaign, has been in close contact with the president-elect since the election.

Last week, Meta said that Kaplan would become the company’s top policy officer, replacing Nick Clegg, who was a former British deputy prime minister and a leader of Britain’s centrist Liberal Democrats party.

Kaplan, who has held several policy related positions at Meta since joining the company in 2011 when it was still named Facebook, is well-known within the Republican party. He was a White House deputy chief of staff under former President George W. Bush and also once worked as a law clerk for former Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.

In December, Kaplan revealed in a Facebook post that he joined Vice-President Elect JD Vance and Trump during their recent visit at the New York Stock Exchange.

“We want to make it so that, bottom line, if you can say it on TV, you say it on the floor of Congress, you certainly ought to be able to say it on Facebook and Instagram without fear of censorship,” Kaplan said Tuesday.

Prominent Republican lawmakers have previously criticized Meta and other technology companies for allegations regarding the censorship of conservative voices on their respective platforms. For instance, House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, subpoenaed Zuckerberg and other tech CEOs in 2023 as part of a probe to “understand how and to what extent the Executive Branch coerced and colluded with companies and other intermediaries to censor speech.”

Zuckerberg has had a rocky relationship with Trump over the years, with the president-elect more recently describing Facebook as an “enemy of the people” in a March interview with CNBC. Meta levied a two-year suspension on Trump’s Facebook and Instagram accounts in 2021 shortly after the company determined that the former president’s actions following the Jan. 6 insurrection in Washington, D.C., could potentially incite more violence.

In 2023, Trump was able to regain access to his Facebook and Instagram accounts, but he also faced some restrictions and potential penalties if he were to violate the company’s community guidelines. Meta eventually removed Trump’s account-related restrictions in July during the lead up to the 2024 U.S. presidential election.

Stocks,Finally Disneys time? Disney gets a price hike from 100$ to 147$ by Redburn Atlantic,"[Disney gets price hike](https://www.investing.com/news/analyst-ratings/disney-stock-upgraded-as-structural-issues-fade-and-momentum-strengthens-93CH-3799433)

Over the past few months, I’ve grown increasingly bullish on Disney’s future. While the stock hasn’t shown much movement over the last decade, the company has been doing everything right to set itself up for long-term growth. With a market cap sitting around $200 billion on $92 billion in annual revenue, Disney’s valuation feels disconnected from its progress. Since 2015, the company’s revenue has more than doubled, yet its market cap is roughly the same (200 billion).

# Strength in Content and Streaming

In my experience, Netflix often feels like it’s missing something when it comes to content. Disney, HBO, and Hulu consistently deliver shows and movies I actually want to watch. Disney, in particular, has an edge with Marvel, National Geographic, Star Wars, Pixar, 21st century Fox, ETC.

Disney has started bundling with HBO in certain packages, creating an offering that feels far superior to Netflix. Even so, Netflix’s market cap is nearly twice Disney’s, despite Disney rapidly growing its subscriber base. With its dominance in family-friendly content, especially during key times like the holidays, Disney is primed to keep adding users. For instance, they leaned hard into promoting their holiday classics over Christmas, likely driving a solid bump in subscribers this quarter.

# New Experiences and Expanding Horizons

Disney is also doubling down on experiences. Their cruise lines are already a huge draw for families, and they’re not slowing down. Over the next six years, they plan to launch a new cruise ship every year, expanding their footprint in the vacation market. Add to that their private island in the Bahamas, Castaway Cay, and I personally am looking on taking my family on a Disney cruise.

# Sports Streaming and Strategic Acquisitions

Sports are another big opportunity for Disney. Their recent 70% acquisition of FuboTV is a smart play, setting the stage for their new sports streaming service, Venu. Combining this with their existing ESPN+ platform, Disney is carving out a strong position in the live sports market. This is a smart move in a space that’s still underserved compared to traditional entertainment streaming.

# Future Outlook

Looking ahead, Disney feels like it’s finally turning the corner. Between its content, innovative experiences, and strategic acquisitions, the company has a lot going for it. By 2030, I wouldn’t be surprised to see Disney’s market cap exceed $600 billion. Here’s why:

1. Streaming: Disney+ is on track to challenge Netflix in subscriber numbers, especially with its strong family-friendly focus.
2. Experiences: Cruises, theme parks, and new attractions like Bluey are drawing in more families and boosting revenue.
3. Sports: With Venu and ESPN+, Disney is poised to dominate sports streaming.
4. Diversification: Their wide range of franchises and properties gives Disney a steady pipeline of opportunities to grow.

A big reason Disneys stock has not grown for so long was due to the impact of COVID on move goers and on Disney experiences. Movies are back: The new Deadpool was the highest R rated movie of all time at nearly 1.4 billion in revenue, Inside out 2 became the highest grossing animated film ever at nearly 1.7 billion, and Moana 2 will also break the billion mark. That is: 3 of the 4 highest grossing movies of 2024 are from Disney. And Disney has many more exiting movies in the pipeline. These films typically give a bump to their streaming services, which I expect to be the case with Films like the manadlorian and the bluey film

Now is the perfect time to buy this stock IMO. The stock hasn't yet recovered from covid, but will this year.

My prediction: 300 billion market cap by 1 year from now for DIS","['DIS', 'DIS', 'DIS', 'DIS', 'NFLX', 'DIS', 'DIS', 'DIS', 'NFLX', 'NFLX', 'DIS', 'DIS', 'DIS', 'DIS', 'DIS', 'DIS', 'DIS', 'DIS', 'DIS', 'DIS', 'NFLX', 'DIS', 'DIS', 'DIS', 'DIS', 'DIS']",0,59,35,2025-01-07 12:46:39+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1hvqnlt/finally_disneys_time_disney_gets_a_price_hike/,0.9864
Stocks,Shares of Tencent fall 5% in Hong Kong after U.S. adds firm to list of 'Chinese military companies,"Shares of Chinese tech heavyweight Tencent Holdings tumbled 7% in Hong Kong after the company was added to a list of “Chinese military companies” by the U.S. Department of Defense.

The move follows a near 8% fall in Tencent’s U.S. depository receipts on Wall Street.

Other Chinese companies added to the list included battery maker CATL, which is part of the supply chain for automakers such as Ford and Tesla.

CATL shares, which fell as much as 5.6%, were last down 2.8% in Shenzhen.

The National Defence Authorization Act of 2024 says that the DoD will be prohibited from procuring goods or services directly from entities on the list in June 2026, and indirectly from June 2027.

In response to the decision, Tencent said in a statement that its inclusion on the list was “clearly a mistake.”

“We are not a military company or supplier. Unlike sanctions or export controls, this listing has no impact on our business,” the company added.

CATL also called the designation “a mistake” in a response, saying it “is not engaged in any military related activities.”

The U.S. has taken aim at Chinese tech companies in its bid to restrict transfer of high-end technologies to China. Last year, it revoked certain licenses to sell chips to China’s Huawei in May and unveiling new sweeping export controls on critical technologies in September, including quantum computing and semiconductor goods.

In 2022, the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security said companies must apply for a license if they want to sell certain advanced computing semiconductors or related manufacturing equipment to China.

Stocks,UFC Chief Dana White to Join Mark Zuckerberg on Meta Board of Directors,"In a surprise move, UFC chief Dana White will join the board of directors of Meta Platforms Inc, the tech giant that owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp.

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg — an avid mixed martial arts fan — announced the addition of White and two other board members, John Elkann and Charlie Songhurst, Monday.

“Dana, John and Charlie will add a depth of expertise and perspective that will help us tackle the massive opportunities ahead with AI, wearables and the future of human connection,” Zuckerberg said in a statement.

In a post on Facebook, Zuckerberg said that he had been working on add the nw board members for a while, and of White he wrote that “I’ve admired him as an entrepreneur and his ability to build such a beloved brand.”

“I’ve never been interested in joining a board of directors until I got the offer to join Meta’s board,” White added in a statement. “I am a huge believer that social media and AI are the future.”

“I am very excited to join this incredible team and to learn more about this business from the inside,” he added. “There is nothing I love more than building brands, and I look forward to helping take Meta to the next level.”

White joins John Elkann, the CEO of European investment firm Exor, and the executive chairman of Ferrari, and Charlie Songhurst, a veteran technology investor, on the board.

Zuckerberg and White are friendly, with the Facebook founder an occasional guest at UFC matches. Zuckerberg has also trained with UFC fighters, and competed in local MMA bouts in California.

White is also very close with incoming President Trump, who Zuckerberg and other tech moguls have tried to forge a relationship with ahead of his second term.

My logic is that after seeing AMD fall 8.84% (10.560$) post market, could this mean market sentiment could be in favor of NVDA. I think this because they are direct competitors, since AMD dumped, would this entice people to put money into NVDA due to the fact that their main competitor may not be able to keep up.

StockMarket,My takeaways from today's AMD call,"• Still best server CPU's  
• Still best gaming CPU's  
• New gaming GPU's expected early 2025  
• New HPC-AI GPU MI350X now expected sooner  
• Current MI300X have 2.7x improved inference  
• Investment towards improving AI library software  
• Increased offering of custom chips to customers  
• Maintained MI300x partnership with IBM Cloud  
• Better revenue, margins, income EPS since FY2023

Forward moving opinion: I can see gaming segment income improving in 2025 as consumers who bought GPU's 4 years ago during COVID lockdowns opt to upgrade old PC's to new ones that handle generative AI. Beyond that, client segment revenue will stay strong due to CPU dominance. Also, AMD is aware of Broadcomm and Marvell and is actively pursuing ways to cut them out with AMD's own custom AI chips. Lastly, AMD's earlier release of MI350X's will mean bigger piece of the pie for attracting more HPC-AI customers.

Eval: AMD trades 26% lower than price at EOY 2023 despite making almost double EPS in 2024. The reason why NVDA dropped 18% during DeepSeek FUD while AMD only dropped 7% is largely because AMD investors are holding strong. As a general rule, I avoid investing based on hype.

StockMarket,AMD Earnings Today 2/5/25,"NEWS: GPU and HPC-AI stock AMD releases earnings today 2/4/25. Earnings performance will be influenced by CPU/GPU sales, current demand for MI300X GPU's, and HPC-AI forecasts for Instinct MI350X GPU's (likely better value inference than NVDA) expected in H2 2025. Details below:  
  
For 2024, the best overall and gaming CPU is likely the AMD's Ryzen 7 9800X3D (better value than Intel's Core Ultra 9 285k). In addition, the most balanced CPU for work/gaming is likely AMD's Ryzen 9 7950X (better than Intel's Core i9 14900K which is MUCH less energy efficient). AMD's Ryzen 7 5700X3D is likely most flexible for upgradability (AM4 support for older MOBO).   
  
In 2024, Intel has been a huge disappointment with SUBSTANTIAL 13th and 14th generation CPU stability issues. This coupled with poor price per value leads AMD to dominate the CPU sector. Despite this, AMD has fallen largely due to reduced projected forecasts in HPC-AI after competitors began announcing making custom silicon.

**Technicals:** PLTR absolutely exploded and hit $102 premarket, currently watching $100 level to see if we continue the move. Other than that unlikely to be trading this unless we have massive volume come in.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The PLTR ER highlighted the growing demand for AI-driven solutions across government/commercial sectors. Company emphasized securing substantial contracts in the competitive AI landscape, important because they are more closely aligned with the current government.

**Risks:** Obviously being more closely tied to the government means that it has more leeway to be more monopolistic in their actions, Alex Karp and Peter Thiel are closely aligned.

**Technicals:** After the insane move we've seen from $150 to $118, I actually don't consider this to be earth shattering news- China has always been trying to develop their own semis and not using NVDA for training is what they were ""supposed"" to be doing due to the trade restrictions. I'm still long but selling calls against my position, recovery might be slow for NVDA. It's interesting that they are attempting to bypass CUDA, which is essentially the ""standard"" for ML/AI training nowadays on NVDA chips and developing their own.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** DeepSeek's move to adopt domestic GPUs and bypass CUDA indicates they're aiming for technological self-reliance amidst U.S. export restrictions, rather than trying to adopt more NVDA chips (which presumably isn't a viable long term strategy).

**Risks:** Nvidia faces potential revenue loss if Chinese companies increasingly adopt domestic GPUs and alternative programming frameworks. The effectiveness of U.S. export controls may be undermined as Chinese firms develop workarounds.

StockMarket,Tesla is the most overvalued stock in history - And Shareholders are partly to blame.,"Let’s call it what it is—Tesla is the most overvalued stock in history. It’s been fueled by a mix of retail FOMO, media hype, and the cult of Elon Musk, who has masterfully convinced people that Tesla is more than just a car company. But when you strip away the buzzwords—“AI,” “robotaxis,” “energy revolution”—what’s left? A company that sells electric cars, faces increasing competition, has declining margins, and still can’t meet the production and tech promises it made years ago.

Tesla’s fundamentals don’t justify its valuation. Other automakers are rapidly catching up, yet Tesla shareholders continue to act as if the company is untouchable, pricing in decades of hypothetical dominance that looks less likely by the day. Meanwhile, Musk’s erratic leadership—whether it’s Twitter meltdowns, impulsive business decisions, or outright lies about self-driving timelines—gets excused time and time again.

And here’s the real problem: Tesla shareholders are complicit. They don’t just tolerate Musk’s narcissism; they enable it. Every stock split, every overpromised and underdelivered product, every blatant SEC violation—investors eat it up because they’ve built their financial futures on the myth of Musk’s genius. They defend him like a prophet, ignoring reality as long as the stock price keeps them feeling smart.

The question isn’t if reality will catch up—it’s when. And when it does, Tesla’s valuation will go down as one of the biggest bubbles in market history.","['TSLA', 'TSLA', 'TSLA', 'TSLA', 'TSLA', 'TWTR', 'TSLA', 'TSLA']",796,246,172,2025-02-04 13:00:28+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1ihh3aa/tesla_is_the_most_overvalued_stock_in_history_and/,0.3898

StockMarket,"Microsoft vs nvidia better bet for 10,000$?","Microsoft Vs Nvidia better bet for 10,000 $?

Hello fellow investors,

I’m currently evaluating a $10,000 investment over the next year and am deliberating between NVIDIA (NVDA) and Microsoft (MSFT). Given the dynamic nature of the tech industry, I would appreciate your insights on the potential trajectories of these two companies.

NVIDIA (NVDA):

NVIDIA has solidified its position as a leader in AI hardware and chip technology. The company’s GPUs are integral to various applications, from gaming to data centers and autonomous vehicles. Recently, NVIDIA’s market capitalization surpassed Microsoft’s, making it the world’s second-largest company by market cap.  ￼

However, the emergence of competitors like China’s DeepSeek, which has developed a cost-effective AI model, poses potential challenges. DeepSeek’s advancements have raised questions about the sustainability of high capital expenditures by US tech companies on AI.  ￼

Additionally, recent geopolitical developments, such as the imposition of new tariffs by the U.S. on imports from Canada, Mexico, and China, have led to market volatility. NVIDIA’s stock experienced a decline, which some attribute to these tariffs and the competitive pressures from companies like DeepSeek.  ￼

Microsoft (MSFT):

Microsoft continues to be a dominant force in software and cloud computing. The company’s strategic integration of AI across its product suite and its partnership with OpenAI underscore its commitment to innovation. In Q1 2025, Microsoft reported a 16% year-over-year increase in revenue, with the Microsoft Cloud division seeing a 22% surge.  ￼

However, analysts have raised concerns about Microsoft’s reliance on NVIDIA for its AI and cloud computing efforts. As competitors develop custom AI processors, Microsoft’s dependence on third-party hardware could impact its competitive position.  ￼

Considerations:
	•	Growth Potential vs. Stability: NVIDIA offers significant growth potential, especially with the increasing demand for AI applications. However, this comes with higher volatility due to market competition and geopolitical factors. Microsoft provides a more diversified portfolio, potentially offering more stability but with comparatively moderate growth prospects.
	•	Valuation: NVIDIA’s rapid ascent has led to high valuations, which may be susceptible to market corrections. Microsoft’s valuation, while also elevated, is supported by its diverse revenue streams.
	•	Risk Factors: NVIDIA faces risks from emerging competitors and geopolitical tensions affecting its supply chain. Microsoft’s risks include its dependency on external hardware providers and the need to continually innovate in the competitive cloud space.

Given these factors, I’m interested in the community’s perspective. Which company do you believe offers a better investment opportunity over the next year, considering the current market dynamics and potential risks? Your insights and any additional considerations would be greatly appreciated.","['MSFT', 'NVDA', 'MSFT', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'MSFT', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'MSFT', 'NVDA', 'MSFT', 'MSFT', 'MSFT', 'MSFT', 'MSFT', 'NVDA', 'MSFT', 'NVDA', 'MSFT', 'NVDA', 'MSFT', 'NVDA', 'MSFT']",0,26,16,2025-02-03 23:04:44+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1ih2web/microsoft_vs_nvidia_better_bet_for_10000/,0.988

StockMarket,Amazon and Tariffs : It's not tricky ?,"I am truly amazed that the stock is performing so well, considering that Amazon is the symbol of international trade. I find it hard to understand how Amazon could not be impacted by all this bad news: customs duties, inflation, GDP slowdown... Of course, people will mention AWS. But AWS is just one business among many, and the others are highly connected to the economy. Consumers will be less inclined to spend if prices rise significantly. Moreover, with the decline in immigration, I assume that some warehouses will face labor shortages, as will delivery services in certain areas.

Maybe it’s the upcoming quarterly results that are keeping the stock afloat. Especially since all this uncertainty around tariffs reveals a certain asymmetry between Trump and his administration—I can hardly imagine Trump giving up on his tariffs just because Canada or Mexico decide to deploy personnel at the border.

  
To be honest, I decided to let go of my Amazon shares, even though I like the company. Of course, everything looks very bullish at the moment, but I don’t want to engage in trading. I’m aiming for the mid-term.

StockMarket,AMD - Short term pain (PUTS),"Short-term pain:

The market doesn't know how to grapple with efficiency gains associated with the DeepSeek-R1 release.

Will efficiency gains lead to a lowering of demand for AMD AI hardware?

* Long-term (unlikely): Commoditization of large language models will likely lead to quicker adoption of AI and increased capital expenditures. Efficiency gains will be superseded by high adoption rates.
* Short-term (uncertain): Positive indications from Microsoft and Facebook during earnings indicate that capital expenditures will not slow down relative to the DeepSeek-R1 release.
* AMD guidance is historically tepid. If this trend continues, expect short-term sell-offs as investors continue to assess the effect of DeepSeek on the broader AI market. Even with positive indications from large hyperscalers.

 

Future tariffs will apply greater pressure on AMD's consumer portfolio

As it stands, AMD will not be immune from the effects of future tariffs.

* Increased prices on laptop and desktop processors
* Increased prices on gaming GPUs and SoCs (Poor holiday console sales, we will likely see a year/year decrease in revenue)
* Effects on data center revenue although not as pronounced (less price-sensitive buyer)

 

Conclusion - There is too much uncertainty around AMD to be bullish going into earnings. Data center segment growth will likely exceed expectations, but without strong guidance DeepSeek-R1 release and the prospect of less AI hardware demand will likely overshadow beats in data center growth. Future tariffs will also put downward pressure on both the top and bottom line for forward-looking guidance. I will be looking to buy puts today going into earnings (if reasonable). The current put call ratio is 0.82, which I expect will increase over the coming days.","['AMD', 'AMD', 'MSFT', 'AMD', 'AMD', 'AMD', 'AMD']",0,2,2,2025-02-03 12:47:11+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1igo9wm/amd_short_term_pain_puts/,0.9091

StockMarket,DeepSeek Jailbreak Reveals Its Entire System Prompt,"Probably still just the tip of the iceberg of what we'll learn in the days to come. There seems to be a mounting credible sentiment that the model wasn't created on a $6M budget either. 

TLDR summary: 

>Within two weeks of its global release on Jan. 15, DeepSeek garnered 2 million downloads, creating a stir in Silicon Valley and causing a 3.4% drop in the Nasdaq, partially due to a $600 billion loss in Nvidia's stock. However, its success was overshadowed by cyberattacks, with DDoS traffic originating from multiple countries and escalating in severity. 

>To mitigate the attacks, DeepSeek temporarily restricted new accounts. Despite this, on January 28, the company released an upgraded version of its AI model. **Yet, the following day, a database leak exposed sensitive information such as chat histories and API keys. On January 31, further testing by Enkrypt AI revealed significant flaws in DeepSeek, noting it was highly biased, toxic, and prone to generating dangerous or insecure content.**

>Despite these concerns, Enkrypt AI's CEO, Sahil Agarwal, praised DeepSeek as an engineering marvel, especially for being open-source, allowing for community contributions. He acknowledged its shortcomings but emphasized that other AI models could be even worse, with DeepSeek simply receiving more attention due to its high profile.",['NVDA'],101,27,20,2025-02-02 16:40:20+00:00,https://www.darkreading.com/application-security/deepseek-jailbreak-system-prompt,-0.8232
StockMarket,Everything is BAD,"Deepseek has ushered in a new era where China is demonstrating that it can compete with the United States in the field of AI. As a result, we are entering a form of trade war where cost and efficiency take precedence over the glorification of a supposed American monopoly on AI.

Trump is going to impose tariffs on everyone. American companies will have to spend much more on imports. Trump has admitted that the coming months will be difficult. However, he has failed to understand that no country can be entirely self-sufficient.

By imposing a 25% tariff on Canada and Mexico, he is penalizing U.S. businesses. Worse still, Canada has refused to back down and has imposed equivalent tariffs, with some Canadian companies even deciding to ban U.S. products. In other words, U.S. businesses will have to pay more for imports while facing greater difficulty in exporting, given that Canada is the United States' largest importer. Canada is also prepared to take measures reminiscent of COVID-era restrictions to allow its businesses to adapt to this new vision of trade. Some even advocate closer ties with the EU to facilitate trade.

But that’s not all: The CEO of Nvidia, already struggling to find a new solution for his business model and maintain high profit margins, has now been informed by Trump that chipsets produced abroad will also be heavily taxed…

And next in line is Europe. The only ""good"" news is that in Europe, courage has been absent since 1930. We have a courtier mentality: weak with the strong, strong with the weak. I highly doubt Ursula von der Leyen will act as Canada did.

Edit : At the same time, the U.S. economy is slowing down, with GDP growth weakening and inflation remaining persistent and resistant despite the Fed’s efforts

StockMarket,Can somebody tell me if my summary of what I’ve recently learned about the stock market is correct,"7 tech companies are responsible for 30% of the s&p500 now. That means if those companies ever massively lose value due to a tech bubble, we will see people’s retirements absolutely *implode*. It just so happens we are in such a bubble, our market cap is at 200% of our GDP. 

The recent developments with AI in China have poked a major hole in this tech bubble because investors of all sorts just saw that this can be done much cheaper, and energy effective than they were told by these American tech companies. Think about the investments that won’t be because of this news, we were looking at essentially quadrupling our energy output as a nation because of the massive power requirements of the data centers we thought we needed for powerful AI, that’s insane amounts of money invested in power plants etc that is potentially no more. Also the investments in data centers themselves, and the companies by extension. If we see investors return these companies to a more sensible valuation, that means major trouble for the US economy the likes of 2008, or worse. Tesla is a wonderful example of inflated value while their fundamentals tell a different story, they aren’t selling so many cars, or creating tech or anything like that which justifies the high stock price, rather Elon being close to power has given them an insane bump (I believe it literally doubled the stock price). Many tech companies stock prices are built on this massive hype around AI, making our market ripe for economic calamity.

About my stock picks, i adapted my strategy in regard to Trump's policy. I bet on 3 sectors :

\- Technology : i sold my Nvidia stock to take some from other AI tech companies and profit the bound. I consider in the new AI market, Nvidia as too expensive. They will lose its strong point : high mergin.

\- Financial : Of course, Financial companies got very very good earnings, and Trump has not deregulated the market yet. So that could be the year of finance services.

\- Energy : It's tricky. I make a big difference between oil and gas. Trumps wants Oil price fall by flooding the world with US oil. For me, this is the worst for Oil companies. They make money, not with quantity, but with the high price. But, i got an opposite position about gas. Today, the demand is higher and higher. Europe wants to be independant from russian gas. Moreover, Gas could be the best energy for AI industries, because Nuclear is too complicated to develop in short and middle term.

Catalyst: Apple reported EPS of $2.40 vs. $2.35, and revenue of $124.3B vs 124B.

Despite these positive results, the company provided cautious guidance for the upcoming quarter, citing uncertainties related to the impact of new AI features on sales. Tim Cook mentioned that Apple Intelligence DID lead to stronger sales/growth in areas where it was rolled out (it has limited rollout right now).

Volume/Market Cap/Technicals: Watching $250 level, no strong bias. We've seen AAPL swing close to 20% this month, (on report of sales weakness in China) but doubt this will continue.

Context: Most immediate news that comes to mind was the weakness of sales in China for the iPhone, causing the move this month.

Risks: Don't really see immediate risks beyond the trade war, in 2019/2020 this resulted in AAPL moving manufacturing/production to other countries in SouthEast Asia- slowing growth in China has been pretty consistent, however.

Catalyst: Kerrisdale Capital released a bullish report on ACM Research (ACMR), a semiconductor wafer fabrication equipment (WFE) company positioned in China but headquartered in America.

It leads China as a leading supplier of wafer cleaning tools and beneficiary of China's push toward semiconductor self-sufficiency.

Kerrisdale predicts the company to eventually compete globally and cites it as a potential 10x return. Trades at 1x 2025E revenue (likely due to China fears).

Volume/Market Cap/Technicals: This is the interesting part- ACMR holds a $1.2B mkt cap but trades at a massive discount compared to its Chinese subsidiary (ACMS), which has a $5.9 billion market cap and trades at 6x 2025E revenue.

The report suggests that ACMR’s NASDAQ valuation is severely mispriced and could re-rate significantly as investors recognize the valuation gap.

Context: China/US chip war, you guys know what this is.

Sector Context: The global semiconductor industry is shifting, with China attempting to localize chip production.

Kerrisdale argues that restrictions on U.S. and Japanese WFE exports to China will only fuel ACMR’s growth as Chinese fabs increasingly turn to domestic suppliers.

China's WFE self-sufficiency has grown from 4% in 2019 to 17% in 2024 and is expected to reach 36% by 2026.

Risks: Geopolitical factors, including further U.S. export restrictions, could impact ACMR’s operations. Similar to how we have the NVDA trade restriction going on right now.

However, Kerrisdale sees these restrictions as a net positive due to ACMR having less competition in China as a result.

There are other players in the WFE space in China, but ACMR has a technological moat.

Context: This earnings report is Intel's first since the departure of CEO Pat Gelsinger. Also worth thinking of the NVDA/Deepseek/semiconductor news when reading through these catalysts.

Catalyst: ASTS has received special temporary authority from the FCC to test its space-based cellular broadband network in the United States. Allows for collaboration efforts with VZ/T.

Volume/Market Cap/Technicals: Slight rise, but will watch this at open to see if volume comes in.

Context: The FCC's authorization allows ASTS to provide cell/satellite comms, allowing for greater coverage and signals that more use of ASTS satellites. I remember that the company was essentially valued based on each satellite they launched successfully in 2024,

whether that hype returns remains to be seen but overall not interested in trading this unless we have retail interest again.

Sector Context: SpaceX's Starlink is also entering the direct-to-cell market, as I noted a few days ago- most of the investment that can be done in these type of cell/sat comms in public markets can really only be done in ASTS.

Risks: If SpaceX IPOs we might see a selloff in this stock simply because SpaceX is far larger/established and Elon Musk has closer ties to the government.

StockMarket,"Am I missing something about AI, Deepseek, and NVDA?","While I’m not deeply immersed in the world of AI or chatbots, I’m aware that they’ve been around since the early days of the internet, like AOL 3.1. What’s fascinating is how rapidly they’ve evolved. DeepSeek, for instance, has made significant strides in optimizing AI to run on less powerful hardware, even enabling it to operate on local PCs. I experimented with running it on my own machine, and while the performance was notably slower—taking about 10 minutes to generate a response compared to the near-instant results of the web version—it was intriguing to observe the AI’s thought process in real time. This local implementation is roughly 1,000 times slower, underscoring the need for more robust processors for optimal performance. However, that’s not the crux of my observation.

The real question is whether AI will remain confined to its current role as an advanced chatbot. What about its potential to create complex outputs like charts, diagrams, 3D renders, full-length videos, CGI, and other sophisticated media that I can scarcely imagine? To achieve such feats autonomously, AI would require computational power on an entirely different scale—orders of magnitude beyond what’s available today. Consider this: I struggle to render a simple 10-minute edited video on my current setup, and that’s just processing pre-existing assets. The idea of AI generating and rendering high-quality, original content—like a 10-second CGI clip, let alone a full-length feature—seems almost inconceivable with today’s technology. NVIDIA, as a leader in GPU innovation, is already at the forefront of this computational arms race. While cheaper chips may suffice for basic chatbot functionalities, the “big boy” tasks—those requiring immense processing power for creative and analytical endeavors—will continue to demand cutting-edge hardware. As AI grows more sophisticated and tackles increasingly complex challenges, the demand for advanced chips will only intensify. In essence, while AI’s capabilities are expanding, the underlying hardware requirements are becoming more formidable, ensuring that companies like NVIDIA remain indispensable in this evolving landscape.

So let's see what deepseek thinks about this topic:

  
As an AI developed by DeepSeek, my purpose is to assist and enhance human capabilities in various tasks, not to replace or make any specific technology obsolete. NVIDIA, a leading company in GPU technology, plays a crucial role in many fields, including AI, gaming, professional visualization, and data centers. Here’s how AI and NVIDIA’s technologies intersect and complement each other:

1. **AI Development**: NVIDIA GPUs are widely used for training and running AI models due to their parallel processing capabilities. AI advancements often rely on the computational power provided by NVIDIA hardware.
2. **Acceleration**: NVIDIA’s CUDA platform and Tensor Cores accelerate AI computations, making it possible to train complex models more efficiently. AI frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch are optimized to run on NVIDIA GPUs.
3. **Collaboration**: AI can enhance the capabilities of NVIDIA’s hardware by optimizing algorithms and improving performance in various applications, such as autonomous driving, healthcare, and more.
4. **Innovation**: NVIDIA continues to innovate with new architectures (like the Hopper and Ampere architectures) and software solutions (like NVIDIA AI and Omniverse) that push the boundaries of what’s possible in AI and other fields.

In summary, rather than making NVIDIA obsolete, AI and NVIDIA’s technologies are more likely to continue evolving together, each driving advancements in the other. My role is to assist and provide insights that can help users leverage these technologies effectively.","['NVDA', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'NVDA']",15,11,6,2025-01-31 09:14:49+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1ieawl3/am_i_missing_something_about_ai_deepseek_and_nvda/,0.9953
StockMarket,"AMD, the biggest winner of Deepseek case ?","Last year, I listened to an analysis of AMD’s position in the AI market. I was very surprised by the intelligence of AMD executives' approach. They started with the idea that they could not compete directly with Nvidia, as Nvidia has a technological lead that is difficult to catch up with in the short and medium term. Instead of lowering their heads, they decided to develop excellent chipsets that are sufficient for the vast majority of AI models, all at significantly lower prices than Nvidia.

This market segmentation strategy made sense. If we look at the PC GPU market, Nvidia dominates the high-end segment, but 90% of gamers use entry-level and mid-range graphics cards. The idea is to focus on those 90% of consumers to reduce the research and manufacturing costs associated with the remaining 10%.

While Meta and Amazon have shown interest in AMD, AMD has not made major announcements about multi-billion-dollar contracts like Nvidia does. Its product is not ""sexy""—the H100 is somewhat of a Lamborghini for show-offs. Ultimately, tech companies have preferred to spend lavishly on H100s to say, ""Look, we have the best hardware for our AI."" But these are extremely high costs that will need to be justified someday. Professional investors have started to reflect on this issue, pointing out that tech companies are very expensive and that the promised financial returns from this new market are still awaited. While Nvidia was one of the few to demonstrate actual cash flow from AI by selling expensive chipsets, the companies commercializing AI had not yet shown convincing revenue figures.

In this debate on AI profitability, DeepSeek arrives: it is possible to create better AI models with 90% fewer technological resources. In other words, Nvidia has enriched itself at the expense of so-called tech experts like Sam Altman, Alex Karp, and Elon Musk—none of whom are engineers—the same people who claimed that AI was exclusively an American technology.

Unsurprisingly, tech figures like Mark Zuckerberg did not hesitate to appear in business media to defend their strategy. For them, these expenses are logical and justified. Of course, they are not going to admit that they wasted billions of dollars out of sheer ignorance and egotism.

But today, how can we believe that such expensive AI can exist in a market that has just opened? DeepSeek has shown that AI is no longer just a story of the big tech giants (GAFAM). There is an opportunity to create better AI with much less money.

Who can offer alternatives to Nvidia’s extremely expensive chipsets today? AMD.

In the end, even if Meta and Microsoft continue to spend money recklessly on Nvidia processors, other companies are becoming increasingly aware of this issue, and AMD seems ready to provide a solution.

StockMarket,"Stocks Are Seriously Undervalued – They Don’t Follow the Market Up, But Crash Hard on the Way Down","It’s becoming painfully obvious—stocks are **massively undervalued** right now. When the market goes up, stocks barely move. When the market goes down, they **crash hard**. And it’s not just the market trends; **short-sellers seem to be controlling a lot of this volatility**. Take a look at what's been happening with the **S&P 500** and overall stock market action:

🔻 **January 2025:** S&P 500 **plunged multiple times** due to rate fears and heavy shorting:

* **Jan 10:** Down **1.5%**, wiping out early-year gains. Bond yields spiked, killing the “soft landing” narrative.
* **Jan 27:** Down **1.46%**, driven by a **record Nvidia drop** that dragged the tech sector down.
* **Jan 29:** Down **0.5%** after the Fed held rates steady—investors wanted rate cuts, didn’t get them.

🔻 **August 2024:** S&P 500 **crashed 6% early in the month** before recovering to **+2%**. Why?

* Weak manufacturing & jobs data sparked **recession fears**.
* Japan’s surprise **rate hike** rattled global markets.
* A major **tech sell-off** added fuel to the fire.

🔻 **April 2024:** S&P 500 **fell 4.2%** in one month, one of the worst in 2024:

* Bond yields jumped, making stocks less attractive.
* Inflation didn’t cool as expected, delaying Fed rate cuts.
* Geopolitical tensions added uncertainty.

But here’s the kicker: **Short sellers** are absolutely running the show. The number of **highly shorted stocks** has been climbing, with some of the largest names having **over 20% of their shares shorted**. It’s clear that many stocks are being **dragged down** artificially, especially when we look at how little upside they show during rallies. These positions are **suppressing the true value** of many companies, creating a **perfect storm for short squeezes**.

**Shorting has pushed many stocks below their fair value** and, as a result, the market is hugely disconnected from reality. Earnings are strong. Corporations are leaner than ever. But shorters are in control and **holding down the price action**.

This disconnect can’t last forever—when it corrects, expect a **massive rally**, especially if a **short squeeze** hits.

StockMarket,DD: What is going on with China's recent developments in quantum computing?,"Google [Tianyan-504](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=tianyan-504&t=newext&atb=v452-1&ia=web). Google [Zuchongzhi 3.0](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=tianyan-504&t=newext&atb=v452-1&ia=web). Google it, right now. Who’s reporting this? China is right behind the USA in quantum computing research, and the markets don't seem to have a clue.

TL;DR: Simply put, I believe the markets have not reacted to China’s most recent advancements in quantum computing. China is potentially not as far behind the USA as markets would have you believe. I provide here a commentary of recent market movements, in relation to recent quantum computing news and developments. I follow with a more technical discussion of the significance of China’s advancements, those of US corporations.

Financial disclaimer: While I justify my comments where possible, some of the comments I make in this post are pure speculation. I do not recommend making speculative trades, such as shorting quantum computing, or buying quantum cybersecurity. I am not a financial advisor, and this is not financial advice.

  
I was astounded to see the latest news dominating the headlines. How did the market not know that China was developing its own language-learning models? I’m a filthy casual, and even I knew about it. It’s been in our news at least [since July](https://www.marktechpost.com/2024/07/20/deepseek-v2-0628-released-an-improved-open-source-version-of-deepseek-v2/), and available for use [since September last year](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/news/news0905). It was pretty fucking good back then, too. And there’s Alibaba’s Qwenchat, Tencent’s HunYuan, among numerous others they haven’t even started talking about yet. What else have they forgotten, in this wild speculative bull run? They probably think the USA is lightyears ahead in quantum computing too. Oh, oh. They do.

Before you go any further, look up [Tianyan-504](https://english.cas.cn/newsroom/cas_media/202412/t20241206_893281.shtml). Look up [Zuchongzhi 3.0](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11924). Google them, right now. They’re right there, massive Chinese developments both announced in December 2024. The Tianyan-504 surpasses 500 qubits, on par with IBM’s latest developments. And Zuchongzhi 3.0 demolishes Google’s earlier Sycamore by all key metrics. Why can’t we find any article produced by any reputable financial sources, that discuss the significance of these achievements? There is essentially zero market news about it. China is right behind the USA in quantum computing research, and the market has no fucking clue. 

Check out D-Wave stock prices, for example. Given their business model relies in part on how they contribute to research in the field, they should be negatively impacted by major research developments in competing economies.

[D-Wave Systems: China’s announcements had no impact on its price](https://preview.redd.it/96wym59tk6ge1.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&s=327df2e7ebaf6e0f06138e6d7b60b044e6aec743)

This suggests that while Google’s Willow breakthrough rallied quantum computing stocks and Nvidia’s CEO pushed them back down, China’s developments have had zero impact.

How about Quantum Computing Inc (QUBT)? It tells a similar story. Their focus is on fabrication of photonic quantum computing components – and again, providing researchers access to quantum computing technology. It looks like Google’s Willow breakthrough rallied stocks, and Nvidia’s CEO pushed them back down. China’s developments have had zero impact.

[Quantum Computing Inc: China’s announcements had no impact on its price](https://preview.redd.it/p5a8zc79l6ge1.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&s=a8b9868405de23d491e4eb752102315f975735d1)

How about IBM? News about Google’s Willow pushed their price down some 3%, which makes good sense. Willow’s performace blew that of IBM’s September R2 Heron processor out of the water. Willow is a competitor, but IBM’s position in the market means they are diversified in so much more than just quantum computing. A small bearish reaction makes perfect sense. So when Tianyan-504 reportedly challenged IBM's benchmarks just three days before Willow did, why didn’t the stock price move?

[IBM: China’s announcements had no impact on its price](https://preview.redd.it/rbp8n83bl6ge1.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&s=066a0a2eaac3524cb3ae527f857180cd22e21b40)

You can look at SkyWater Technologies (SKYT), and at Global Foundries (GFS), and Rigetti (RGTI), Alphabet (GOOGL), Intel (INTC), TSM (TSM), Keysight Technologies (KEYS), and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). Every one of these key companies relevant to advancing quantum computing in the Western World have one thing in common. When China announces their developments, the markets appear to stay still.

There are three possible reasons for this that I have come up with. There may be other reasons as well that I am not aware of, in which case I encourage you to enlighten me.

The first possible reason is as above: The market is generally not aware. It is likely that some players in the market are aware, and this is a simple piece of information that such players will be taking advantage of – they do not have incentive to highlight this knowledge. Furthermore, the market may be uniquely slow to react. Unlike DeepSeek, which we can physically interact with, breaking records in quantum computing research is less tangible, less sensational. Breaking news, markets are irrational.

The second possible reason is simple: China may be lying. I can not find any evidence to support this idea, and China’s past claims about quantum computing, such as those about [Jiuzhang](https://asiatimes.com/2023/10/china-unveils-faster-light-based-quantum-computer/), have been demonstrably true.

The third possible reason is that China’s quantum computers are not as technically advanced as they sound. Originally I wanted to follow with a full technical discussion about the recent history of Chinese Quantum computing, and the merits of Tianyan-504 and Zuchongzhi 3.0 in comparison to western quantum computing efforts. But since I am not a subject matter expert, and I do not have the time to write in full depth. But I will provide a bit more technical information, summarise and provide references to the academic research for relevant breakthrough technologies, so you can read for yourself.

China is fighting to lead the global race in quantum computing, and [the Chinese government has been investing tens of billions of dollars into quantum computing research](https://thequantuminsider.com/2023/04/13/chinese-quantum-companies-and-national-strategy-2023/), alongside the investments of Chinese institutions and corporations.

In 2020 [Jiuzhang, developed at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), was the second quantum computer in the world to achieve quantum supremacy](https://asiatimes.com/2023/10/china-unveils-faster-light-based-quantum-computer/), and the first photonic quantum computer to do so. Since then, the university has gone on to create further models of Jiuzhang, and develop chips with greater qubit lifetime and fidelity.

In April 2024, The Center for Excellence in Quantum Information and Quantum Physics developed their [Xiaohong superconducting chip](https://english.news.cn/20240425/a95b3c190a59486886f4cddc0def31cd/c.html), their most advanced to date, anticipated to reach the chip performance levels of main international cloud-enabled quantum computing platforms such as IBM’s Heron in key performance metrics including qubit lifetime (how long a qubit can hold its quantum state) and readout fidelity (accuracy in extracting information from qubits). I note the market did not appear to react to the Xiaohong chip either.

On the 13^(th) of November 2024,[ IBM announced their Quantum Heron R2](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/blog/qdc-2024), achieving their goal of running quantum circuits with up to 5,000 two-qubit gates, demonstrating advancements in in qubit lifetime and readout fidelity.

On the 6^(th) of December 2024, [Tianyan-504 was announced](https://english.cas.cn/newsroom/cas_media/202412/t20241206_893281.shtml), developed by China Telecom Quantum Group (CTQG) in partnership with the Chinese Academy of Sciences and QuantumCTek Co., Ltd., and, built on the Xiaohong chips. China is now the only country to achieve quantum computational advantage through both photonics and superconducting quantum computing technologies. This quantum computer will be incorporated into their quantum computing cloud platform, and made available for researcher purposes.

On the 9^(th) of December, [Google’s Willow was announced](https://blog.google/technology/research/google-willow-quantum-chip/). What makes Willow exceptional, is that it provides a breakthrough solution to quantum computing’s fidelity issue. It exponentially reduces the amount of error while adding more qubits. Presumably Willow can now be scaled further, and I expect to see further developments with adding more qubits now that this challenge has been solved.

Two weeks later, on the 16^(th) of December 2024, an entirely separate research team with the China Telecom Quantum Group (CTQG) in partnership with the Chinese Academy of Sciences and QuantumCTek Co., Ltd. [announced their Zuchongzhi 3.0](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.11924v1#S1). This superconducting quantum computer makes numerous advancements, and demonstrates quantum advantage through speed. It crushes benchmarks set by Google’s older Sycamore - “Compared to Google’s latest experiment, SYC-67 and SYC-70  the classical simulation cost of our 83-qubit, 32-cycle experiment is six orders of magnitude higher.” Though Zuchongzhi 3.0 does not demonstrate the error correction capability that Willow does, their creators have commented that they believe they can replicate the same techniques in a matter of months.

Quantum computing is still twenty years away from being relevant, they say. That gives lots of time for China to catch up. And from what I can understand, China is just one breakthrough away. There are other questions, such as China’s chip manufacturing capabilities, supply chains for components, that I am unable to find good information on. The US is doing what they can politically, through trade regulation, and restricting financial investment in China’s technologies. China already has the [lead in quantum communications, and potentially in quantum sensing](https://itif.org/publications/2024/09/09/how-innovative-is-china-in-quantum/). But China holds one massive advantage: it’s regime. In contrast to the American model, where corporations closely guard their own secrets from eachother, [China is claims they invest 15 billion of dollars into coordinated, cohesive research.](https://itif.org/publications/2024/09/09/how-innovative-is-china-in-quantum/) And it is showing in their results.

Each advancement that China makes in developing its quantum computing capability, ought to remind the market that there is a risk that the lead the US enjoys in quantum computing is being threatened. But look at those google search results again. Outside of technical circles, the western media simply hasn't picked it up. Look at what happened with DeepSeek. I think the markets just don't know. Investors are already anxious about their investments in quantum computing, and are starting to demand returns. Manufacturers are reluctant to scale component production, given the low demand and potential for volatility. So when the market does find out about China’s achievements in quantum computing, what's going to happen?

Catalyst: Reported earnings of $8.02 vs $6.68 expected. Revenue of $48.4B vs $47B,but guided revenue short of consensus and didn't provide FY25 revenue outlook (which triggered the reason for the selloff post-earnings after the close).

Their CAPEX announcement was $60-65B vs $52.4B expected, and stated they expected the single largest driver of expesive growth in 2025 as infrastructure costs due to higher OpEX and depreciation.

Also announced plans to grow META's AI team significantly.

Volume/Market Cap/Technicals: Earnings move the stock on far less volume but the initial selloff after announcement was worth trading- interested in the $700 level today but not much beyond that.

Context: Decent earnings but signals that there is more spending on the horizon- likely that the initial brutal selloff to $606 was from algos just reading the initial eye-popping CAPEX number and selling the company.

Sector Context:There is a major next-level breakthrough that OpenAI is expected to release today that has agents performing on the same level as PHDs, Altman is meeting today with US government officials. META is the creator of Llama, which is another open source model compared to OpenAI's closed models.

Risks: Deepseek has been the main threat involved, with competitors from China using distillation and other AI techniques to be able to train a far cheaper model that brings up the question of why our large tech firms are spending so much on GPUs. (I'm sure this is news to you /s)

Related Tickers: FAANG stocks, SNAP, PINS, etc.

Catalyst: Reported earnings of $0.73 vs $0.76 expected. Revenue of $25.71B vs $27.23B expected. Most of this revenue miss came from miss in sale of EVs. 

TSLA announced interesting plans to lower the price of EVs  in 2025 but also didn't give specific details regarding the production volume targets (as they have in the past), and also announced that there would be a paid robotaxi service in Austin in June. This puts them in competition with Waymo/UBER. Personally I think the vision-only approach is not viable in the long-run but hey, I'm no self-driving PHD. 

CAPEX was ALSO higher as with META due to spending increases from AI training infra costs and battery production capacity.

Volume/Market Cap/Technicals: I'm mainly interested in the $375/$400 level, not too interested in going long despite the multi-day slide in price.

Context: Main reason for TSLA's selloff was the lack of full-year guidance (it gives the subtext that it's too bad to release publically or it's up in the air). Political statements made by Musk may contribute to future issues for TSLA.

Sector Context: Revenue shortfall was caused due to lower-than-expected vehicle deliveries/ increased sale incentives, 496K cars vs 507K exp. China's BYD is rapidly catching up, and the (possible) removal of the US EV tax credit may make EV's more expensive

Risks: Mainly geopolitical- if the tariffs on EV vehicles imported to the US gets removed, TSLA will face fiercer competition from BYD. Also Elon Musk.

Related Tickers: BYD (but mainly trades in China, TSLA isn't as impacted by AI news.)

Catalyst: The reveal of Deepseek has introduced an AI model that rivals existing solutions but was developed at around $6M. However there's a rumor that Deepseek is actually trained on 50K H100 NVDA gpus.

Yesterday after the close, there was an announcement Trump officials discussing tightening curbs on Nvidia's China sales.



Volume/Market Cap/Technicals: Overall, there's been a massive selloff since NVDA was $150 at the end of last week. Overall interested again if we hit $116, but low confidence we'll sell off again. 

Currently long.

Sector Context: Not much to really say about this beyond NVDA having the most advanced chips that are widespread for training because of the CUDA architecture- most people are doubtful that the TOTAL cost was $6M

US Officials are examining export restrictions but China will likely find a way to bypass them as they have previously.

Risks: Mainly geopolitical, again. Obviously it's very difficult to restrict trade to a country that we have no military presence in or surround, and China is economically far more powerful than those we have attempted trade restrictions on in the past.

StockMarket,Hardware 3 Is Useless for Autonomy: Implications,"
I don’t get how everyone’s glossing over the fact that Elon literally admitted Hardware 3 won’t cut it for self-driving. For years we heard “flip of a switch” and boom, your Tesla’s a robotaxi. Now it’s, “Oh, you actually need Hardware 4” (or maybe 5 next?).

Meanwhile, there aren’t even that many Hardware 4 cars on the road, and full autonomy definitely isn’t happening in six months. They’re supposedly starting in Austin, probably with a safety driver babysitting the whole thing, and it’ll be a very slow ramp, assuming they can scale at all. 

Musk also admitted training Optimus is a much bigger lift than he let on. If FSD is any indication we are a longggg way off.

We’ve already seen Tesla repeatedly overpromise and underdeliver—whether it’s FSD, production numbers, or financial projections. But now, with regulators looking the other way and politicians either enabling or actively shielding Musk, there are effectively no consequences for misleading investors.

If there’s no real enforcement, what’s stopping Tesla from manipulating numbers to prop up the stock? And if investors and analysts just keep buying into the hype regardless of fundamentals, what’s the point of even pretending these earnings reports mean anything?

StockMarket,Nvidia is not doomed (but valuations are still stretched),"I think deepseek is going to get into hot waters within the next few weeks. How does one company manage to buy GPUs, set up a team, pay the team (literal quants btw so don't expect it to be cheap) and create the AI with 5 million dollars. I think something is not adding up, whether it's the AI or the books. I think they either a) somehow embedded a code in their AI to source and generate results from other AI. Or b) Their books are completely cooked and this costed way more than 5 million dollars. Either way this is going to be classified as a fraud of some sort and whether or not the Chinese gov will go to court for it is another issue, but if this was in the US, the FTCs alarm bells would def be going off right now.


Not to mention the AI is currently under attack by cyber criminals. It's most likely from big tech (MSFT, Google, Nvidia) as a ""punishment"" for dragging their stock down. But if you're ready to announce to the world that you made a world changing AI and NOT expect someone to retaliate, then there's something wrong with you.

StockMarket,Seems like it's a well coodinated efforts by the WS shorters. I can't wait to see Gemma Squeeze,"This is not AI generated spam. This is my personal view on what is happening today. 

DeepSeek V3 was released to the public on December 26, 2024. By early January, the market was already aware that DeepSeek outperforms OpenAI's GPT-4o and Meta's Llama in benchmark tests, having been developed at a cost of only $5.58 million.

In early January, Nvidia dropped as low as $129 due to profit-taking after reaching the height of $153+, partly influenced by the DeepSeek news, but it recovered to $147 just last week. So why the sudden barrage fearmongering articles now triggering a sell-off?

It’s not that the demand for Nvidia chips will drop; it’s about how to produce superior LLMs using the latest Nvidia chip in the AI race. Imagine what the DeepSeek team could achieve with Nvidia's latest chip. We are only at the start of AGI, they still need those high tech chips in the AGI and ASI race.

StockMarket,$500B Stargate AI Project: What Sectors and Stocks Could Win Big?,"So, the $500 billion Stargate AI Project was just announced, and honestly, that’s a huge amount of money being thrown into AI and related tech. It’s got me thinking: what sectors and companies could ride this wave in the near future? If history tells us anything, investments of this scale tend to shake up entire industries, with both big names and under-the-radar players benefiting.

Let’s break it down by sector because there’s a lot to unpack here:

1. Semiconductors: The Brains Behind AI

AI doesn’t run without hardware, and semiconductors are at the heart of it all. GPUs, CPUs, and those fancy AI-specialized chips are the foundation of machine learning. Companies like Nvidia, AMD, and Intel are already dominating this space, and I wouldn’t be surprised if they see even more demand. Nvidia, especially, is practically the poster child for AI hardware. Their growth has been insane, and a project of this magnitude could push it even further. Expect AI chips to continue driving their revenue in the coming years.

2. Cloud Computing & Data Centers

AI projects need a ton of computing power and storage. That’s where the big cloud providers—AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud—come in. These companies are likely already gearing up to grab their slice of the Stargate pie. Then you’ve got data center companies like Equinix and Digital Realty Trust, which could also benefit. All this AI data has to live somewhere, and these companies provide the backbone for hosting it.

3. AI Software Players

It’s not just about the hardware—companies building the actual AI tools and software are in a great spot, too. Think Palantir, C3.ai, and Snowflake. These players already help businesses make sense of their data and implement AI-driven solutions, so they could see a major surge in demand. The rise of AI as a service (AIaaS) could also give these companies a big boost as the Stargate Project moves forward.

4. Startups: The Dark Horses

This is where things get really interesting. While the big names are obvious winners, startups working on niche AI applications (think robotics, edge computing, and automation) could also see some major growth. Some of these smaller companies aren’t on anyone’s radar right now, but they could pop up as key players—or even get acquired by the bigger guys. If you’re into high-risk, high-reward opportunities, this might be where you want to look.

5. Telecom & Networking: Supporting the AI Boom

AI depends on fast, low-latency networks to transfer data efficiently. That’s why telecom and networking companies are probably smiling right now. Companies like Cisco, Juniper Networks, and even those working on 5G infrastructure could benefit. After all, all that AI data has to move through fast, reliable connections, and these are the folks making that possible.

6. Autonomous Tech & EVs

This one’s a bit of a wildcard, but it makes sense. Companies like Tesla, Waymo, and Mobileye that are working on self-driving cars and autonomous tech could see a boost. AI is critical for advancing self-driving capabilities, and a major investment like this might accelerate developments in the space.

7. Cybersecurity

As AI adoption grows, so do concerns around data privacy and security. Cybersecurity companies like CrowdStrike, Palo Alto Networks, and Zscaler could also be beneficiaries. Protecting sensitive AI systems and the data they process is going to be a top priority.

So, what do you all think? Are there other sectors or companies that might benefit? Any smaller names worth keeping an eye on? Let’s discuss!

Is it the right Time to Invest in AI Interview Assistance Tools?,"Donald Trump has highlighted and supported the $500 billion for infrastructure tied to artificial intelligence through a new partnership formed by OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank. This will mark a revolution in the AI industry.

In the job industry, AI has already been disrupted, creating and destroying hundreds of jobs. 

A new trend that I have seen recently is the growing number of real-time job assistance tools or AI interview assistance tools.

Yes, it may sound unethical to many but these tools are growing at a rapid pace. Many people are using real-time interview assistance tools to get their dream job.

So, is this the right time to invest in these tools? By investment, I mean, to use it or to fund it.

I have friends who have used these interview assistance tools like LockedIn AI during their job interviews. Some of them also use it during work meetings as it helps in that too.

Also, I know people who are investing in companies which are building these types of AI tools.

Overall, many can say this is a tricky field and against ethics but is it anything ethical happening in the world?

StockMarket,Improving my portfolio,"Hi everyone, 

  
I begin stock picking in november and i got some big poop stock in my portfolio :

\- AMD at 138 dollars : when i see nvidia, qualcomm, broadcomm, tsmc growing fast, but AMD falling from 138 to 110... i guess i make the worst choice ever, even i did in the presentation of the new generation of CPU for BtoC and BtoB.

\- Ocean power technologies:  Lot of ""analyst"" said that was a very good company. I took a position at 1.10 after a fall from 1.80 dollars. I was like ""ok i guess it's the floor. No, today the stock is at 0.80 . And more the time pass, more the stock is falling step by step.

\- Cheniere : i took a position, i waited two weeks to take some because the stock was growing fast. Finally i took at 250 after a fall from 260. Guess what ? the stock is at 235 now ... Like AMD, i begin a position with -6% 

\- Pernod Ricard : Top 2 in premium international wines and spirits. lot of ""analyst"" said the earning was just a tempory issue, and the next earning will be better. But today, like OPTT, the stock is falling step by step : one step forward, two steps back.

Honeslty, i dont knwo what i can do with that. I would like to complete my portofolio with Energy stocks and financial stock (i took an ETF finally), and some tech. But the price are growing, i don't know when i should take a position. I've been monotoring Intuitive surgical.

Spinning off foundry business is good move.

StockMarket,The Carvana Bear DD you should read,"TLDR: Carvana is not just cooking the books, but also their online image. They are employing shills to spruik the company's image online and bully customers out of making faulty car returns. Multiple alternative data sources point to worsening financials in Q4 2024 and beyond.

**Introduction**

Carvana is an online used-car retailer that gained rapid traction over the past few years by offering a distinctive, digital-first car-buying experience. However, over the last four years, the company has grappled with a litany of challenges, including ballooning debt, operational missteps, and controversy surrounding its financial disclosures.

[Hindenburg Research's](https://hindenburgresearch.com/carvana/) short report on Carvana alleges significant financial improprieties, including $800 million in loan sales to a suspected undisclosed related party, accounting manipulation, and lax underwriting practices. The report suggests that these actions have temporarily inflated Carvana's reported income, raising concerns about the company's long-term sustainability and transparency.

Carvana has denied this obviously, calling them ""intentionally misleading and inaccurate."" but hasn't actually said much of substance to refute them. I found Hindenburg's report credible, but I was also concerned by several analysts upgrading their rating for Carvana, so I did my own research.

# The subtle signs that Carvana is not well

https://preview.redd.it/ocmcssu25wde1.png?width=531&format=png&auto=webp&s=b6f199d76d50fa5af19d764787305959a49f0852

# Carvana has been bribing employees to post good employee reviews.

I investigated Carvana’s Glassdoor reviews and how that had changed over time. I discovered a deluge of fake 5 star reviews in May (and likely to a lesser degree in prior months). The spike is so ridiculously large compared to surrounding months, their contents are so obviously self-serving and are entirely from ""current employees"", when for every month since there has been a roughly even balance of current vs former employee reviews. **These reviews are clearly manufactured**

https://preview.redd.it/kjkkpj245wde1.png?width=911&format=png&auto=webp&s=2401060afd0cd619b7fc1c8ff514ce421893ea7d

A Carvana employee that I spoke to told me that employees were encouraged to make Glassdoor reviews due to the wave of negative reviews the company received after their mass layoffs. Furthermore, there is further evidence online of the **company paying employees in-kind** to burnish the company image

https://preview.redd.it/9fmtu4i65wde1.png?width=481&format=png&auto=webp&s=607d9f9c702a0b4341b87cd0a9042c80a91bb198

So what does this hide? Well it means that its[ Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com.au/Reviews/CARVANA-Reviews-E750603.htm) rating of \~3/5, is probably more like \~2/5, which is extremely poor, and well below its competitors. Share prices for companies with poor Glassdoor ratings tend to do worse than their competitors. Companies with fake ratings I assume do even worse (albeit maybe not in the short run).

Now the reviews outside the obvious fakes reveal a consistently negative view of the company with rampant nepotism, problematic loan practices, fraud, covert firing practices and poor training (someone went through the most problematic ones [here](https://manvsdebt.com/my-open-letter-to-ernest-garcia/)). I suspect this may have been a motivating source of evidence for the recent Hindenburg report.

**Despicably someone at the company appears to be very proactive in using Glassdoor to deal with PR problems**. On their Glassdoor page there are very few reviews that relate to maternity leave (30 out of 3000 over an 8 year period). However, in September 2024, **three** positive reviews were made about the company's maternity benefits compared with a long term average of 0.3 reviews per month. This includes [one on the ](https://www.glassdoor.com.au/Benefits/CARVANA-Maternity-and-Paternity-Leave-US-BNFT23_E750603_N1.htm?countryRedirect=true)**exact same day** (below) that a lawsuit was filed against Carvana for unlawfully firing a woman for being pregnant. Innocuous at first glance, but statistically **so unlikely** to be a coincidence.

[Who thought going after pregnant women was a good idea?](https://preview.redd.it/mcy6k5395wde1.png?width=423&format=png&auto=webp&s=44d19cb50ef87075f421fe8454487339f5a2556f)

# Carvana employees are illegally posing as neutral third parties online to discourage customers from returning low quality cars.

I can’t post my evidence of this because of Reddit rules (it got my previous account banned). **What I will stress, is that it’s illegal under the FTC act to pose as a neutral third party in a way that results in a financial gain for the company.**

**I have now reported Carvana (and two employees I suspect are behind it) to the FTC.**

# Carvana is manipulating its customer reviews

Carvana's trust pilot rating stands out from its competitors in both numbers of reviews (despite doing much less business than competitors) and its rating. The only company with a similar rating is DriveTime – (owned by Ernest Garcia II aka Ernest Garcia III's dad).

https://preview.redd.it/uwf2s14c5wde1.png?width=280&format=png&auto=webp&s=915443fd5544d8c3aa95524b0d7b235fc958cc08

Both companies have been flagged by [Trustpilot](https://au.trustpilot.com/review/carvana.com?page=2) for using methods that manipulate positive reviews. However, the reviews are also consistent with very happy sellers (**not a controversial statement**) being overpaid by Carvana, with most reviews flagging virtually non-existent quality assurance.

The problem is, if you are buying used cars, you need to be rejecting at least some cars, you can't let everyone have a positive experience - it's literally the classic adverse selection problem. You will simply end up holding bad cars (or bad loans if you manage to sell them). In fact, almost all negative reviews come from buying low quality cars.

Anyways, I then scraped the data from Trustpilot. And again, I find clear evidence confirming manipulation. When the company was in dire straights in June 2022 and service quality was deteriorating. The company responded by suggesting trustpilot reviews to those most likely to give it positive reviews (presumably sellers).

# Ally Financial, Carvana and did Hindenburg get it wrong?

A large part of the Hindenburg short thesis is Carvana's heavy reliance on Ally Financial for purchasing its loan book. They note that other banks have considered partnering with Carvana, which would help them diversify, but have pulled out upon seeing their underwriting practices. For Carvana this poses a massive key business risk because if Ally pulls out, Carvana can't extend car loans. Hindenburg argued that a pull out looked likely as Ally scaled back its 2nd and 3rd quarter purchases and in September 2024, Ally reported an unexpected surge in delinquencies, with its CFO [warning](https://www.bamsec.com/transcripts/f5a760e2-2507-46e6-a628-2af1ddbc441c?hl_id=njr4ed0ewl): “on the retail auto side, our credit challenges have intensified”. Furthermore, Hindenburg's report also came with warnings **from Ally executives** themselves that delinquency rates were getting too high.

But Ally didn't pull out. Only a few days ago, **Ally doubled down**, renewing their deal for another year and increased purchases to $4bn.

So did Hindenburg get their short thesis wrong? Why would Ally Financial double down on Carvana’s auto loans when they have been **publicly signalling** a move away? Furthermore, why work with a company that they **know is cooking their books**?

Two reasons. Firstly, Ally may be greedy regards, in which case short Ally. But the more likely reason is that they are bleeding Carvana like a stuffed pig.

Ally are Carvana's **only** ***real*** buyer. They wield immense power over Carvana, and this power has grown as the auto market has soured and other banks have gone on record against Carvana. Ally are clearly aware of the growing risks, and if anything, Hindenburg has given them more negotiating leverage. Looking at their actions with the benefit of hindsight, the 2nd and 3rd quarter loan purchase reductions should not be seen as them wavering. Nor should its public announcements of higher auto loan losses. Instead, they were signalling a credible **threat** that they would walk away if they didn't get a better deal. Remember they're no stranger to dealing - they've already renegotiated 5 times in 2 years and they know that if Carvana didn't get a deal they'd go bust. They played chicken and Carvana blinked.

Can we check the details of the deal? No - they've **redacted** this information from their filings. There's your **big red flag**. This is consistent with Ally being increasingly picky with what loans they are willing to take, expect them to pay less and to be buying loans with better FICO scores.

Expect a good next quarter from Ally, and a negative one from Carvana (if they’re honest…)

https://preview.redd.it/pz86cmjg5wde1.png?width=1256&format=png&auto=webp&s=3e90da5341be084b772d223ab03554f1ad7de082

# Where next for Carvana?

Well, they're being squeezed on both ends (growing auto losses and worsening deals with Ally). This will cut into margins on lending particularly in Q1 (which make up a large share of their apparent profit). Their response to Ally's bullying in Q2 and Q3 was fraud. Now thanks to their new agreement, we can probably expect them to hold (or hide) even more of their worst performing loans.

As revealed by Hindenburg, Carvana is being subsidised by his father’s private company Drivetime. Drivetime’s financial details are opaque, however it is known that they posted a loss of $69.3 million year end of 2023. This figure, even if we assume DriveTime’s favourable dealing was costing them **twice this amount** annually, is still a bargain for the Garcia family. At Carvana’s current stock’s valuation, their stake (which they are selling) has grown rapidly to $20billion. So, for a paltry sum to keep the company afloat through favourable transactions, they can sell Carvana stock at crazy valuations. If needed, the proceeds of these sales can then be put back into DriveTime (without people noticing) for far less than what the favourable transactions cost. So, this too is likely to continue until the market wises up.

Another direction they may take that has not been picked up by short reports, is to get their risk down. Their actions over the past two years have meant they are buying increasingly expensive lemons. This is causing problems in several areas. While they hold the cars, they are making an immediate heavy theoretical loss. When they try to sell the cars, it is costing them time, delivery costs, labour costs, depreciation, and legal costs when those cars are returned within the warranty period. Then even if the car is not returned, because they are selling loans, the collateral on the loan is a worthless. So, if the car fails and the person needs it for work, they will default. Likewise, if the loan fails for other reasons, even if they do repossess the car, it will have little resale value (for loans that they still hold). They’re finally wising up to the fact that as an auto finance provider compared with simply a used car retailer, it is in their interest to be selling at least somewhat usable cars because of this enduring financial relationship.

https://preview.redd.it/xb6urdgh5wde1.png?width=426&format=png&auto=webp&s=d384231f22d31d6faa5b9c62e8b44ab5a086fb3f

Two years ago the company went through large layoffs in their [operation division](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/carvana-layoffs-2500-workers-zoom-email/#:~:text=Carvana%2C%20blaming%20a%20%22recession%22,Garcia%20said%20in%20the%20email) to bring down costs. At the time, the Carvana workforce was heavily mismanaged. There was a clear need to do greater diligence on car purchases, as the quality of cars had deteriorated significantly during COVID. However, reports show that many employees spent their days idle, playing video games or not showing up to work.

Management evidently realised that if they could still sell cars without doing due diligence on them then they lay their employees off. This made it virtually impossible to repair/assess cars all the cars they now bring in, and most work now is cosmetic (if at all). For this leaner model to work, it required that reduced compensation would need to outweigh worsening auto losses (as it leads to more lemons)

However, it was clearly **unsustainable** and so in contradiction to his recent vague interview about turning the company around and finding efficiencies, they are just turning back lol. They now have close to a thousand open positions on LinkedIn most of which are in... you guessed it **operations. Reflecting this hasty turnaround**, many of their roles in automotive repair even offer substantial signing bonuses ($5000+).

Now of course these numbers could also be reflective of a company that is expanding to new geographies – but it’s not. Carvana is currently expanding its facilities in Belton, Atlanta, Portland, Las Vegas, and Oklahoma – these account for 6, 17, 17, 7, 19 of the jobs listed. So, the remaining 90% of their new hires are in existing locations.  

So, they might be set to vet their cars more. But it also means that the whole turnaround story that they've spun over the past 2 years is junk. They haven't found some hidden secret to abnormal profits. They will face higher labour costs and lower margins and all they have to show for it is a costly restructure, fraudulent accounting and a worsening loan book.  Lastly, they were unprofitable before, how does reverting help?

# Insiders are showing signs of distress.

Ernie’s rate of greying has accelerated rapidly from approximately 7% grey hairs to 38% in just three years

https://preview.redd.it/ha21sgtj5wde1.png?width=593&format=png&auto=webp&s=c3fa013ebe2169278105f5dffe185c7322511072

This greying is remarkable, because his father (who happens to be older than his son lol) still has colour in his hair. In fact, I predict that Ernest III will overtake Ernest II by Q3 2026. Carvana bulls might blame Ernest's mother's genetics for his early greying; however, I think that convicted criminal Ernest II is just simply better able to handle the heat in the kitchen.

# Ira and Georgiana Platt’s lifestyle recession

**Ira has been the Chair of Carvana's Audit Committee** for the past 7 years. According to Hindenburg, ""*Ira has long-standing links to the Garcia family. Platt acted as a banker for DriveTime (then called Ugly Duckling) stretching as far back as 1998, per SEC* [*records*](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/106415899000049/6?cik=1012704&hl=104779:104788&hl_id=vyl9gerbbl)*.

Platt joined Carvana at the* [*time of the IPO*](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/169082024000138/1?cik=1690820&hl=35989:36072&hl_id=4koxsgb-bl) *in 2017.

Good corporate governance would argue that the audit chair should be independent, instead almost his entire net worth consists of Carvana stock (although thankfully, he is rapidly selling stock - nice!).

Now some investors try to infer market information from changes in prominent employees' spending. They should instead look at their family members, particularly wives, who typically organise a much larger share of household spending and who don't face restrictions on social media.

https://preview.redd.it/tsyusdul5wde1.png?width=554&format=png&auto=webp&s=5f85d9a366d65654743ba93b79a353a1d723a94a

Georgiana Platt lives a charmed life, she regularly posts to social media, travels frequently, and likes to give back to the community. She has had an unremarkable career as an event planner and Microsoft excel coach. However, she has amassed immense wealth through her astute investments in Georgiana Ventures LLC a ""*Private investment enterprise that structures, aggregates and leads capital investment in innovative enterprises with rapid growth profiles and strong leadership in emerging marketplaces*."" She even employs her husband Ira as the LLC's sole employee. In reality this is just a vehicle to hold and protect Ira's ill-made millions (see [here ](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/119312517156305/7?cik=1690820&hl=62835:62861&hl_id=njerrlhbbe)listed as an investor in Carvana's IPO).

I have attempted to estimate Georgiana's spending habits to predict Carvana's share price. Scraping her social media accounts I have determined her travel log over the past 6 years. I used this to generate a travel spending index, where every time she travels interstate I give it one point, and every time she travels internationally I give it two points. To reduce noise I have excluded her regular travel between her three homes (Louisiana, Utah and Connecticut - not a bad life hey). And to smooth it out, I have averaged the index over 3 months.

As Ira is an insider you would expect that his foreknowledge of business problems, would make Georgiana's spending habits a leading share price indicator. Using her travel index score as a 12 month leading indicator, the index **very closely** matches Carvana's share price movements. The one exception is the first half of the COVID period where travel was heavily restricted (although during this time she made several posts complaining about cancelling trips). **Note**: the shaded part refers to the leading time series dates (not the share price time series) where we would have expected greater travel spending - absent COVID

https://preview.redd.it/83w5a0mn5wde1.png?width=631&format=png&auto=webp&s=29d2aec31f77936d60084011fd46aea91afa672c

Looking at her travel over the last 12 months, we see a massive drop from approximately 4 flights a month, to less than 0.5 (Georgiana Platt has not been on a plane in 2025. I repeat NO FLIGHTS IN 2025!).

Using a forecasting method known as a ruler, I am predicting a price target of approximately $0 in one year's time.

* Could **Meta Platforms (META)**, **Snapchat (SNAP)**, or even **YouTube (GOOGL)** benefit from increased user activity and ad revenue as a result of TikTok's ban?
* Could this trigger changes in ad spend strategies, benefiting platforms like **Pinterest (PINS)** or other social apps?

Currently, I’m heavily invested in AMD because I believe in their bright future and potential for growth. 

However, as you can see in the attached screenshots, I’m wondering if my portfolio is too risky due to the high concentration in a single stock.

The market is inflated. if you don’t think so…ask yourself why so many people have started investing who don’t know what they are doing. how many people who have full faith reoccurring investments in SPY who don’t even care to look at macro issues we have. 

people are blinded by bullish sentiment. 

Most of the MAG7 stocks which make up a significant amount of SPY basically just run off hype. 

TESLA is so incredibly overbought yet every day there’s people posting “TESLA TO 500!” 

Tesla doesn’t even have to release any news. elon could say 2 words on twitter and the stock goes up 30 dollars on the day. 

you don’t think we are in a bubble???

the funny part is, the crisis we enter from this hyper inflated market can’t be stopped. the government is so deep into debt. the most in US history, they can’t bail themselves out. the government almost had a shutdown due to budgeting a few months ago…and you think they can bail us out in a recession???

the government barely has enough money to sustain itself. actually no. it doesn’t have ANY money to sustain itself. 

i’m not sure when, no one does, but when this crash happens, the government will not be there to stop it. they don’t have the money. which means neither do the banks. the current debt we are in has almost caused a shutdown. 

if we enter a recession, the government can’t give out money to banks/stimulus checks/reduce taxes. we are AT the threshold of what the government can sustain. if we enter a recession, the government literally cannot afford it. mix that in with the hyper inflated market…i don’t see how anyone is bullish on the market anymore. 

something horrible is brewing. dumb investors who believe tech will always go up, a government that literally cannot sustain itself financially, and tech making up an overwhelming chunk of the market in which a lot of blind bullish investors are heavily invested in.

StockMarket,Trading and surfing: 5 steps to building your ideal setup,"Hi all,

I'm a husband, and dad of five, and I've recently transitioned to full time trading.

I wanted to post some concepts that I've found helpful in my trading journey, and in doing so maybe help someone who's thinking of, or working on transitioning to full time trading.

Writing out these concepts has been really helpful for teaching myself different nuances in trading and since I was doing it anyway I thought I'd post it here to potentially help others.

Would also love feedback on my concepts and ideas and to hear about how you guys find the right ""conditions"" for your trading setups.

Here's my post:  
(These are basically notes to myself)

What is a trading “Setup”?

To me, a setup is a set of clear conditions needed to enter and exit a trade.

And to help understand these concepts, I like look at them through the lens of surfing.

Here’s what I mean; Surfers need certain conditions to be met in order to enter the water, paddle out, and consistently catch waves.

Conditions like location of the body of water, time of year, and daily weather patterns all play a part. They also need to consider if the surf spot is crowded, what type of waves they’re trying to catch based on the season, where they will start their wave, and where they’ll exit. They also need to ensure there are safety measures in place.

When combined, these conditions determine the surfers chance of success.

After thousands of attempts that surfer will have a very good understanding of the conditions needed to consistently catch waves. And he will be very specific about those conditions being met in the future, to ensure consistency.

Trading is no different.

# Make it your own.

It’s become clear to me that to be successful over time, every trader must build out their own specific trading conditions that need to be met (trade setups) in order to find trading’s holy grail: consistency.

It’s easy to think setups are best copied from your favorite trader—and yes, this is often a good foundation—but consider a quote from one of my favorite trading authors:

""What if we simply focused on what we understand, what we do well, what makes sense to us?"" – Mike Bellafiore

This makes a lot of sense to me because you are a unique person, with certain traits, talents and abilities. You have individual likes, dislikes, goals, desires, and curiosities.

Just as every surfer is unique, so is every trader. You must eventually carve you’re own path.

I started to get super curious about large and mid-caps on the Nasdaq after I came across traders like Steve Spencer and SMB Capital.

Steve shares examples of how to take advantage of intraday moves in these liquid leaders and I wanted to find more examples—to see how and why people are doing this—so I turned to twitter(X). I questioned and observed how people are thinking about setups in this sector.

The volume and variety of ways people trade is mind-blowing. A clear pattern emerged: each trader developed their own set of conditions through countless trade attempts (reps), staying persistent and learning from their mistakes - making small tweaks along the way with each lesson learned.

“There are no silver bullets, only golden bibi’s” - Unknown

Over time I came to realize this sector of the market was a good place for me to start for several reasons:

1. The (mostly) absent fat-tail risk found in small-cap stocks.
2. The liquidity available to get in and out easily.
3. The variety of ways to leverage trades through things like leveraged ETFs and options.
4. The consistency of moves and catalysts that come from these particular stocks, making them easier to catalogue.
5. Scalability over time.

To help you explore this yourself, I’ll explain five common principles to help you find your conditions. I do this to remind myself and to hopefully support you in building your own setups (conditions) to find consistency.

As you read this post, I encourage you to think about a sector or financial product that has peaked your interest for one reason or another, and what conditions might be needed to suit your needs.

# 5 Principles to creating your own setups

# 1. Narrow your focus - be specific. (What body of water will you surf?)

One common theme I see in all successful traders is being in the right stocks at the right time, and being very specific about it.

A common saying amongst traders - “You’re only as good as the stocks you trade”

Let me explain using the surfing analogy again:  
(I’ll be doing that a lot in this post)

”You’re only as good as the waves you surf”

From careful observation over time, surfers know that the best waves typically happen in Hawaii. Specifically on the north shore of Hawaii.

And just like the surfer, not every trade is worth “paddling out” for. Your job is to find the conditions (a location) where the stocks are moving well and most suited to your abilities. Being in the right place at the right time is everything. Think about it, if you don’t have waves to surf you end up swimming in circles. Trading is no different.

In trading this could be narrowing your focus to large caps with at least a $10 billion market cap and trading at least 1 million shares premarket, and trading them at the open of the trading day when there is the most volume. Or you could look at small cap stocks that have gapped at least 20%. Personally, I like large and mid cap stocks that are trading at least 2-3 times their normal volume in the premarket.

Wherever you focus, the principle is this:

Just like the surfer, you must find a very specific location or sector of the market that is known to consistently produce great trades (waves).

# 2. Stocks are like elastic bands (Are we in the right season for surfing?)

Now that we have our first condition - location - we need to find our specific time frame when the “waves” are at their best.

For surfers, November to February is the prime surfing season in Hawaii.  
It’s when the ocean is most “out of balance” and producing the best waves.

Stocks need to rebalance and find equilibrium, just like the ocean.  
We can often see this imbalance when looking at the price chart (I personally like to start with the daily chart in my search).

The more stretched or compressed a stock is, combined with the amount of time it remains in that state, the greater the probability of an outsized move is coming (wave to surf).

Just as surfers recognize certain patterns in the seasons, traders start to recognize patterns in the price charts that show them when a stock is out of balance and whether it’s in the right “season” for trading.

Check out the example below. Here’s a stock that looks out of balance to me and that I think was ready for a wave:

https://preview.redd.it/gauvnirgu7de1.png?width=2551&format=png&auto=webp&s=93618fc78414fd2df5e6c5b4a5e7d1053d6a509b

Nvidia had been building pressure (compressed) for two months. Instead of heading back down, it paused mid-channel, making a “higher low” and started pushing up to the upper level of the trend. The pressure that was building released, and it broke out to the previous high from the candle on the far left. This change in price action (for me it was the higher low) signals it was time to get interested and dig a bit deeper.

Surf’s up!

# 3. Catalysts are key to finding consistency (What’s the weather like today?)

Think about the conditions we have so far:

1. Sector/stock (location)
2. Daily pattern (time of season)

For our third condition, we’re talking about catalysts (think weather on the day)...

In the case of a surfer, they’re observing if the day’s weather conditions match with the location and time of season. If they’re in Hawaii > on the north shore > in January > they know from hard-won experience that the perfect weather includes the following:

* Big Swells: January is part of Hawaii's peak surf season, with large swells generated by winter storms in the North Pacific. Wave heights typically range from 6-20+ feet, depending on the spot (e.g., Pipeline, Sunset Beach, or Waimea Bay).
* Clean Surf: Ideal conditions have minimal wind or light offshore winds (blowing from the land to the sea), which keep the waves clean and well-shaped.
* Swell Direction :A west-northwest to northwest swell direction is optimal for the North Shore, as it aligns well with most surf breaks.
* Mild Air Temperatures: Daytime highs: 75–80°F (24–27°C).Nighttime lows: Around 65–70°F (18–21°C).
* Sunny or Partly Cloudy Skies: Clear weather enhances visibility and comfort.
* Gentle Winds: Trade winds (northeast) are common but should be light to avoid choppy surf. Ideal wind speeds: 5–10 mph (8–16 km/h).
* Water Temperature: Around 75°F (24°C), so a light wetsuit top or rash guard is usually sufficient, but many surfers go without.
* Tide: Tide timing depends on the specific break, but mid to high tide is often preferred for safer and more consistent waves.

Think about how specific that is!  
Now let’s take that principle over to trading.

In the example of Nvidia, the main catalyst was technical (based mostly on the chart pattern). The stock’s daily price action had been compressed for a meaningful amount of time, it then started to deviate and move up on volume, to what I deemed as a very key level. Showing me it was potentially ready to change. This (along with a few other variables that are unique to my needs) confirmed it met my conditions for a potential trade on the day.

The “weather” looked good!

Catalysts can of course be non-technical. They can include fresh news, downgrades, upgrades, or surprise earnings reports. These can all be great reasons to enter a trade.

For example, if the market expects $1 per share in earnings, but the company delivers $1.20—especially from a new revenue stream—it can spark a powerful move.

For the surfer, the weather conditions need to match up with the location and season in order to create good waves.

For the trader, the best catalysts will nearly always match up with the first two conditions; location (stock) and time of season (daily pattern).

With thousands of reps, just as it becomes second nature to a seasoned surfer, the same is true for the experienced trader.

Tip: In the early stages of your trading career, just like a young surfer, be specific and write out every nuance you notice when you see big trades (waves). It could be things like what the volume is doing, what’s the sector doing, how it’s acting in the premarket or around certain key levels, what’s the open interest in the option chains, are there big buyers or sellers on the tape? etc. This gives you more data to cross reference over time and allows you to gain experience faster. Don’t forget to record your screen so you can replay the trades! Upload your recordings to YouTube and set them to private for easy reference.

# 4. Volume (Now we’re in the water, waiting for the wave)

We now have a very solid base of conditions to build on. So far our principles include:

1. Sector/stock (location)
2. Daily pattern (time of season)
3. Catalyst (weather conditions of the day).

Now let’s talk about the fourth principle: Volume (how many shares are being bought and sold in a certain time frame).

Volume flows give you a sense of the probabilities of the expected move actually taking place.

Again, think of it like a surfer waiting for the next wave; they might have perfect conditions on the day, they just need some confirmation…

They may see a rising bump or swell line on the horizon. This indicates an incoming wave. Surfers look for sets (groups of waves) and gauge the wave's size and speed from its appearance far out at sea.

Traders can do the same with volume!

For example: Is the volume increasing or slowing? Is it more than normal for this stock, sector, or time of day? By how much? Is it spiking or constant?

If the volume looks like it’s aligning with your conditions, it’s time to focus.

The wave is coming…

Now one last piece of the puzzle remains.

# 5. Price action (Wait for your signal to enter)

We’re in the water, waiting…Conditions are perfect.

We have our conditions set:

1. Stock (location) ✓
2. Daily pattern (time of season) ✓
3. Catalyst (weather on the day) ✓
4. Volume (water rises on the horizon) ✓

The final piece to the puzzle is price action…

You have a plan in place, you know what you want to see, you just need to wait to see it.

In trading, price action can include things like candlestick patterns, tape reading (one of my favorites), price behavior around certain key levels or indicators, bid and offer sizing on the level II, and many other nuances that simply take time and reps to recognize.

Price action is everything in trading.

It’s the final piece that tells you if it’s go time (or not).

I personally love it because feedback is almost instantaneous.  
Some traders call it the “only truth” in trading.

In surfing I liken it to when you see the white water at the tip of a wave starting to crest, the waves are starting to move faster and break to shore according your angle. This is exactly what you want to see - all signaling your entry.

Time to start paddling.

And depending on the conditions, how hard to paddle. (think position sizing - but more on that later. Right now we just need to practice standing up.)

You’re paddling, you’re feeling the wave starting. You stand up on your board, set your sights on managing your ride, and simply follow your plan to the exit.

All your focus is now on the price action during your trade.

Just as a surfer is watching the wave he’s riding - looking at its curve and shape, its speed, size and watching out for dangers along the way - so is the trader.

You have a plan in place in case you see different variables pop up. But otherwise you’re simply riding the trade, taking the rep and riding as long as you can, or until you get to your target.

Just like surfing, price action in trading is best learned through experience.  
The more you do it, the more nuances you pick up and the more confident you become.

# Bonus principle: Film your surf session, take notes!

In both surfing and trading, reviewing your performance is essential for improvement. Just as a surfer might film their sessions to analyze technique, you can track and review your trades to identify patterns, strengths, and areas for growth.

Journaling your setups, entry and exit points, and emotional state during trades can provide invaluable insights over time. The goal is to iterate—refining your strategy with each trade (wave) to consistently improve your edge and execution.

I hope these principles can help guide as you build out your own unique conditions to become a more consistent and profitable trader.","['TWTR', 'NVDA', 'NVDA']",8,2,2,2025-01-15 20:21:35+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1i26rwv/trading_and_surfing_5_steps_to_building_your/,0.9998

StockMarket,Dips Are Where Fortunes Are Made #ACHR,"Alright, folks, let’s talk about ACHR. If you’ve been following the stock, you know it took a nosedive today. Massive dip. But before we all panic and start dumping shares, let’s take a breath and look at the bigger picture here. I’m a long-term optimist on this company, and dips like this? Honestly, they scream opportunity. Let me explain why.  


Fundamentals Still Look Solid  
ACHR has a strong foundation. They’ve successfully completed key test flights and are making real progress toward scaling production. Their partnerships (hello, United Airlines!) aren’t just hype—they’re strategic moves that set them up for a slice of the eVTOL market pie.  
  
Remember, the eVTOL space isn’t a sprint; it’s a marathon. The tech is groundbreaking, and regulators are catching up. This isn’t just about where ACHR is today but where it could be in the next 3-5 years. If they keep executing on their goals, this dip will look like a blip on the radar.  
  
You know the saying: most millionaires are made during market crashes. It’s cliché for a reason. Let’s take a look at some big names that went through similar rough patches:  
  
Amazon (2000s): Post-dot-com bubble, Amazon crashed hard. People thought the company was done for. Fast forward to today: it’s a trillion-dollar giant.  
Nvidia (2022): Midway through 2022, Nvidia got crushed during the semiconductor selloff, dropping over 50% from its peak. Fast forward to the AI boom in 2023, and it’s now one of the hottest stocks around.  
DraftKings (2021-2022): This stock was hammered as growth stocks fell out of favor, dropping over 70%. But those who bought during the lows saw a massive rebound in 2023 as sports betting demand surged.  
The lesson here? Volatility happens, even to the best. But if the fundamentals are strong (which I believe ACHR’s are), these dips can be golden opportunities.  
  
Why I’m Buying the Dip  
This isn’t financial advice (obviously, DYOR), but I see this as a gift. The market’s overreacting today, as it often does. If you believe in the company and its long-term vision, then today’s price is a chance to load up at a discount.  
  
Of course, there are risks. Not every company rebounds from a dip like this. But for me, the potential reward outweighs the risk. The eVTOL sector is just getting started, and ACHR is well-positioned to be a leader in it.  
  
So yeah, today sucks if you’re already holding. But if you’ve got cash on the sidelines or have been waiting for an entry point, this might be it. Personally, I’m in this for the long haul, and I’m not letting one bad day scare me off.","['AMZN', 'AMZN', 'NVDA', 'NVDA']",0,19,9,2025-01-14 18:34:21+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1i1cx8a/dips_are_where_fortunes_are_made_achr/,0.996
StockMarket,AMD vs. Nvidia: The battle for AI dominance heats up?,"After experiencing a remarkable surge, with its stock price jumping over 100% from $93 to $226 between October 2023 and March 2024, the excitement surrounding its AI accelerator revenue seemed justified. However, reality hit hard when the average selling price (ASP) and margins for the MI300 accelerators turned out to be much lower than expected. This miscalculation led to a significant correction in the stock price, which now sits at $115, which is far below its peak.

Currently, analysts suggest a relative value of $138, while a DCF analysis points to $97.9. With a market cap of $188.31 billion and 1.6 billion shares outstanding, there's a lot to unpack. Institutional ownership is quite strong at 71.34%, which is encouraging, but it's worth noting that short interest is below 5%.

The fourth-quarter guidance wasn’t exactly a confidence booster for 2025. Many analysts are using linear growth models for AI revenue, which can be misleading. The CPU market isn’t expected to grow significantly, but AMD has a projected TAM of $500 billion for AI accelerators by 2028. Even if AMD captures just 10% of that, we're looking at over $75 billion in annual revenue by then—more than triple the projected 2024 earnings.

When we look at profitability, there’s a mixed bag. AMD boasts a solid gross margin of 52.12%, exceeding the 40% target, and strong management metrics (all above 10%). However, the net margin is only 7.52%, which is below the desired 10%. The Piotroski F-Score of 6 raises some flags, showing weaknesses like a declining return on assets and gross margin, while the P/E ratio of 101.9x is much higher than the peer median of 37.8x. On a brighter note, AMD has consistently beaten revenue and EPS expectations over the past several years.

Broader economic factors are also weighing on AMD. There’s been a shift away from large tech stocks to sectors like banking and Bitcoin, and concerns about slower AI infrastructure spending and geopolitical risks are contributing to the stock's struggles. Plus, there's always the looming threat of a significant correction in Nvidia's stock, which could further impact AMD.

Despite these challenges, AMD's recent underperformance has created an intriguing opportunity for investors. The gap between its current valuation and future potential is widening. Insights from CEO Dr. Lisa Su highlight AMD's focus on building customer trust in its new technology and catching up to Nvidia. For instance, the MI325X is only two quarters behind Nvidia's H200, and the launch timing of the MI355X will be crucial.

AMD has several key initiatives in the pipeline that could unlock its potential:

\- Ultra Ethernet and Pensando DPU: Expanding the AI training market in late 2025.

\- ZT Systems: Giving AMD access to major data center projects with hyperscalers.

\- Mature ROCM Libraries: Improving competitiveness, especially regarding total cost of ownership.

\- Support for FP4/FP6/Int8 with MI355X: Removing competitive barriers.

These advancements are largely independent of Nvidia’s moves, which is a positive sign for AMD.

Looking ahead, the upcoming fourth-quarter report in January 2025 could provide a much-needed boost, especially given the low expectations. However, a larger catalyst related to the MI355X might be necessary to surpass the highs from March 2024. If AMD starts showing strong growth while Nvidia slows down, we could see a shift in the narrative, with more investors turning their attention to AMD.

Of course, there are near-term risks, including potential supply constraints for HBM. But AMD's strategy to diversify its suppliers should help mitigate this. Despite these hurdles, the long-term outlook for AMD remains bright thanks to its innovative technology and expanding market opportunities. Although, insider ownership is low at 0.95%, which is something to watch.","['AMD', 'NVDA', 'AMD', 'AMD', 'AMD', 'AMD', 'AMD', 'NVDA', 'AMD', 'AMD', 'AMD', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'AMD', 'AMD', 'NVDA', 'AMD', 'AMD', 'NVDA', 'AMD', 'AMD', 'AMD']",30,44,28,2025-01-14 18:29:48+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1i1ctd5/amd_vs_nvidia_the_battle_for_ai_dominance_heats_up/,0.9975

StockMarket,Recent Activity in Quantum ,"Is quantum a scam? is quantum overvalued? why did quantum drop? what is the future looking like?

So many questions have been brought up in the dramatic rise of quantum computing stocks. Some of the major stocks in this industry include RGTI, IONQ, and QBTS. Shortly put quantum is far from a ""scam"". However, that does not mean it wasn't dramatically overvalued. Stocks like the ones I mentioned incurred extremely high gains in the last few months. But recently all of them dropped significantly. With a combination of the major indices falling into negative territory, NVDA CEO's comments on quantum, and panic selling, prices dropped, and they dropped fast. 

However, this is NOT the first time NVIDIA's CEO has made comments on very useful quantum computing being many years away. I also want to tie this idea into the other idea that it might be beneficial to NVIDIA if stocks like RGTI fall. This is because much of the technology that NVIDIA uses can be overtaken in a much more efficient way, if quantum computing technology continues to grow at the rate it is. ""Once quantum computing becomes powerful enough, it will likely replace some of the uses of GPU data centers with a much smaller footprint and much faster computation,"". This quote was taken from [investors.com](http://investors.com) interview with WallStreet's Davidson, head of technology research: Gill Luria. Additionally, this threat that stocks like RGTI serve to NVDA would become a real possibility in a matter of just a few years (not a multiple decades). Although very useful and mass commercialization of quantum computing may truly be a decade+ away, this threat I am talking about is not. This is just one of possible revenue streams quantum computing companies would be made of within the next few years while they wait for technology to advance. It would not be a shock if these companies rapidly started to grow their earnings within the next few years. 

Lastly, I want to touch on the future of quantum computing. Quantum computing growth is not a question of ""if"", it's just a matter of ""when"". This industry is essential for the rapid advance of all technology. 

This post was made after reading a number of articles, reports, and interviews. A chunk of this information was gained after reading Marc Gerstein's seeking alpha article, ""Quantum Stocks, Including Rigetti Computing, Fell After Comment By VIP, But Reactions Were Irrational"".

Please do your own research and provide any comments regardless of which side of the argument you are on.

StockMarket,Outstanding Returns by Sheer Luck!,"While reading investment books to get the new year started off right, I came across this gem of an anecdote:



In his book *The Smartest Portfolio You’ll Ever Own*, Daniel Solin advocates for a very Bogle-y approach to investing: pick asset allocations based on risk tolerance, use index funds, and rebalance periodically. (That's a one sentence summary of the whole book. You're welcome.)



Here's the interesting bit: In the chapter ""The Myth of Skill"", Solin claims that ""outstanding returns can be achieved by sheer luck."" Definitely a talking point for index investors. To prove this he picks 10 US stock tickers based only on the letters of his last name: S-O-L-I-N; two for each letter. He claims that from January 2010 through November 2010, these 10 stocks returned 45% to the S&P's less than 6%. But what's really interesting is looking at these 10 stocks through today, 15 years later.



If Solin had invested equally in his 10 ""random"" stocks in January 2010 and then forgot about his account until this month, ***he would have 34x his money***!! Sure, this is another NVDA-go-boom story, but it's amusing because of the context of the picks and being forever immortalized in print.



So, buy index funds -- or throw some darts and hang on for the ride.

StockMarket,$AMD Trend Turnaround in 2025-2026: Up to 160% Gains Projected?,"Hey Guys i have a play for 2025 that could give u upto 160% gains. I recently did a long term analysis for AMD and i want to share it with you

**Technical Analysis**

First, you might wonder how I’ve already determined the potential low of the current downtrend, even though it hasn’t officially ended. Here’s why:

In the recent uptrend, which concluded with a bottom, I noticed **three large green candles** forming at the same level as the bottom. Similarly, during the last major uptrend, there were **three prominent green candles** as well. Based on this pattern, I identified a strong **resistance level**, which I believe has a high probability of leading to a trend reversal.

**Why a 33% Chance of Breaking Through Resistance Early?**

In AMD’s previous uptrend, the stock **touched the resistance line three times** before eventually breaking through. Interestingly, in the current downtrend, it has already touched the same resistance line three times.

However, to break through this resistance early, AMD would also need to surpass:

1. The **green trendline**, which previously acted as resistance during another downtrend.
2. The **black resistance line**, which adds an additional layer of difficulty.

Given these challenges, I think there’s only a 33% chance AMD breaks through resistance early.

**Main Scenario**

In my primary scenario, I expect the following:

1. The chart will **bounce off the green trendline** initially.
2. From there, it will **continue to fall to Point C** before bouncing back and break through the black resistance.
3. Over a time frame of approximately **330–400 days**, the stock could rally to deliver **up to 160% gains**.

**How I Determined the High**

The potential high is calculated based on:

* The **reversal rejection** during the recent uptrend.
* The difference between the **all-time high** and the **all-time high before**,  added to the current  alltime high.

This analysis suggests a significant growth opportunity for AMD in 2025, provided the market plays out as expected.

[Potential Gains?](https://preview.redd.it/ab3wuyd7k8ce1.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=b43ebbd5ecb3fdd538d1f895f1f836004d6972aa)

**What I Did and Plan to Do Next**

Current Position

I recently purchased 900 shares of AMD at Point A, expecting the price to rise to Point B in the short term, which is around $141. Once it reaches this level, I plan to sell my shares and reassess the situation based on the possible scenario outcomes. It also could not even reach Point B and go directly to C why i set a stop loss at 110$

Scenario B.2 (33% Probability)

If the price breaks above the resistance line, I will:

* Re-enter the position with 900 shares.
* Hold until the price reaches Point D, which is approximately $222, where I anticipate a trend change.

Scenario C (66% Probability)

If the price fails to break resistance and instead drops to $88 (Point C), I will:

* Buy shares again at this lower level.
* Hold until the price climbs to Point D at around $222, where the trend change should occur.

**Strategy Summary**

My approach is to maximize potential gains by adapting to the chart's movements and leveraging both short-term and long-term opportunities. Whether the price follows Scenario B.2 or Scenario C, my goal is to secure profits at Point D ($222) based on the trend change.

Despite getting smacked by COVID and high interest rates, Uber tightened its belt, doubled down on demand-supply matchmaking, and came out profitable. Wall Street went nuts. Uber is now FCF-positive and aiming for even higher margins.

**So what is Uber today?**

Dara says they’re laser-focused on nailing that perfect supply-demand match. Sure, they’re winning in mobility and they might tackle new verticals like Fiverr-style marketplaces. Sounds great, except they’re missing out on the biggest opportunity of our era, which motherfucking **AI**

Uber collects **11B trips** a year from **160M users**, racking up insane amounts of data (driver reviews, food reviews, social patterns across countless cities etc). This could’ve made them a self-driving powerhouse. But they ditched their autonomous unit in 2020 to cut costs, just as NVIDIA’s Jensen Huang now shows off new automotive processors and partnerships with Toyota, Aurora (who bought Uber’s AV unit), and Volvo. **Uber’s name is nowhere on that list!!!**

https://preview.redd.it/sp025g0iysbe1.png?width=1622&format=png&auto=webp&s=9f335b05d6b23471acba1d8aba29f9af6fe462f3

No matter how you spin it, a simple “supply-demand” marketplace could get overshadowed once autonomous vehicles go mainstream. Especially when you already own the infrastructure for ride-hailing, food delivery, scooters and bikes.

**Activist investors might be licking their chops (at least I would do it If I were them)** at two big plays:

1. **Pull a Reddit:** Sell anonymized data for LLM training and get lots of money, further increasing margins. Instantly, Uber gets an “AI play.”
2. **Sell to Tesla or Google:** Supercharge someone else’s AV ambitions (as well as their foundation models) and get a fat premium in the process.

Meanwhile, the stock still looks undervalued. Uber’s **LTM P/FCF** is around **22.6x**, PEG is **under 1.0x** (Peter Lynch territory), and a Reverse DCF suggests they only need **9.2% revenue growth** (at \~12.4% margins) over 10 years to justify the current price. That’s totally doable.

Here’s how I see it playing out:

1. **Best case:** Tesla or Google acquires them this year and we get a solid premium payday. Probably a stock deal, but it’s still peanuts compared to Tesla and Google market caps
2. **Second best:** Uber pivots to selling AI training data
3. **Not bad either:** Uber dominates more human-driven marketplaces
4. **Base scenario:** They stick to mobility, keep expanding margins, and *maybe* bolt on third-party AVs

WallStreetbetsELITE,There are some sirious overvaluations in Quantum Computing sector.,"I played around with ChatGPT-4o and asked it to analyze the **fair value** of a few companies I was considering adding to my portfolio. I fed him with data from investing.com. When  I came up to to quantum computing firms i realized that looking on todays prices, nobody caresabout fair value of QC stocks.  If anyone thinks that AI-related stocks are in a bubble, take a look at these three quantum computing companies.

Just to be clear, **I don’t hold any positions in these stocks**. I simply believe that their extreme overvaluation is a **major red flag** that should be discussed from time to time—because investing in them could lead to **massive losses**.

I know that for many, fundamentals are not relevant in such speculative area, but nevetheless i decided to share some analysis with you.

Of course, **this is not financial advice** — just a heads-up.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

# 1. Quantum Computing Inc. (QUBT) – 🚨 Extreme Overvaluation

**Quantum Computing Inc. (QUBT)** is a quantum computing company, but its current valuation is completely detached from its fundamentals. The company:

* **Generates only $386K in revenue**
* **Has a market cap of $1.27B**, making it **highly speculative**

# 1. EV/EBITDA Valuation – Not Applicable

* **EV/EBITDA = -62.9x** → Negative EBITDA makes this method unreliable.

# 2. Price-to-Sales (P/S) Valuation

* **Market capitalization = $1.27B**
* **Revenue = $386K**
* **P/S = $1.27B / $386K ≈ 3,290x (!)**

# Industry Comparison

* **IBM (AI + Quantum Computing):** **P/S ≈ 3x**
* **NVIDIA (AI & Semiconductors):** **P/S ≈ 25x**
* **Tech Industry Average:** **10-20x**

If QUBT traded at **P/S = 15x**, an optimistic assumption:

* **Fair market cap = $386K \* 15 = $5.79M**
* **Fair share price = $5.79M / 128.9M ≈ $0.045 (!!)**

# 3. Book Value (P/BV) Valuation

* **P/BV = 21.0x** → Extremely high, indicating overvaluation.
* **Book value per share = $0.64**
* **If QUBT traded at P/BV = 5x**, a reasonable tech multiple:
   * **Fair price = $0.64 \* 5 ≈ $3.20**

# Final Valuation Summary

|Method|Fair Price|
|:-|:-|
|P/S (15x)|**$0.045**|
|P/BV (5x)|**$3.20**|

# The fair value of Quantum Computing Inc. (QUBT) is approximately $0.05 – $3.20 per share.

The current market cap of **$1.27B is highly inflated** – **this company generates almost no revenue and has little intrinsic value**.

⚠️ **Without significant revenue growth, QUBT could see a price drop of over 95%.**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

# 2. D-Wave Quantum Inc. (QBTS) – Still Severely Overvalued

**D-Wave Quantum Inc. (QBTS)** operates in the **quantum computing sector** but is currently unprofitable. Key concerns include:

* **Negative book value** → more liabilities than assets.
* **Negative EBITDA and high net loss** → indicating high risk.
* **Market capitalization of $1.68B** with **only $9.42M in revenue**, suggesting severe overvaluation.

# 1. EV/EBITDA Valuation – Not Applicable

* **EV/EBITDA = -23.6x** → The company operates at a loss, making this metric unusable.

# 2. Price-to-Sales (P/S) Valuation

* **Market capitalization = $1.68B**
* **Revenue = $9.424M**
* **P/S = $1.68B / $9.424M ≈ 178x** (!!)

# Industry Comparison

* **IBM (AI + Quantum Computing):** **P/S ≈ 3x**
* **NVIDIA (AI & Semiconductors):** **P/S ≈ 25x**
* **Tech Industry Average:** **10-20x**

If QBTS were to trade at **P/S = 15x**, which is still optimistic:

* **Fair market cap = $9.424M \* 15 = $141.36M**
* **Fair share price = $141.36M / 291.2M ≈ $0.49**

# 3. Book Value (P/BV) Valuation – Not Applicable

* **P/BV = -99.5x** (!!) – A negative book value means liabilities exceed assets.
* **Book value per share = -$0.084**, meaning the company has no intrinsic balance sheet value.

# Final Valuation Summary

|Method|Fair Price|
|:-|:-|
|P/S (15x)|**$0.49**|

# The fair value of D-Wave Quantum Inc. (QBTS) is approximately $0.50 per share.

The current **$1.68B market cap** indicates **extreme overvaluation**. **With minimal revenue and a negative book value, QBTS is purely speculative.**

⚠️ **Without a significant increase in revenue and profitability, QBTS stock could drop by as much as 90%.**

# 3. Rigetti Computing (RGTI) – Still Overvalued, But Slightly Less Than Others

**Rigetti Computing (RGTI)** operates in **quantum computing**, a highly speculative industry. The company:

* **Has negative EBITDA**
* **Trades at an extremely high P/S multiple**
* **Has a negative book value**

# 1. EV/EBITDA Valuation – Not Applicable

* **EV/EBITDA = -61.8x** → Negative EBITDA prevents meaningful valuation.

# 2. Price-to-Sales (P/S) Valuation

* **Market capitalization = $3.84B**
* **Revenue = $11.892M**
* **P/S = $3.84B / $11.892M ≈ 323.1x** (!!)

# Industry Comparison

* **IBM (AI + Quantum Computing):** **P/S ≈ 3x**
* **NVIDIA (AI & Semiconductors):** **P/S ≈ 25x**
* **Tech Industry Average:** **10-20x**

If RGTI traded at **P/S = 15x**:

* **Fair market cap = $11.892M \* 15 = $178.38M**
* **Fair share price = $178.38M / 280M ≈ $0.64**

# 3. Book Value (P/BV) Valuation – Not Applicable

* **P/BV = 31.3x** → Extremely high, suggesting overvaluation.
* **Book value per share = $0.64**
* **If RGTI traded at P/BV = 5x**:
   * **Fair price = $0.64 \* 5 ≈ $3.20**

# Final Valuation Summary

|Method|Fair Price|
|:-|:-|
|P/S (15x)|**$0.64**|
|P/BV (5x)|**$3.20**|

# The fair value of Rigetti Computing (RGTI) is approximately $0.60 – $3.20 per share.

⚠️ **At a 323x revenue multiple, RGTI is far beyond reasonable valuation. Without strong revenue growth, it remains a high-risk bet.**TL;DR

WallStreetbetsELITE,Thesis: Cardlytics (NYSE: CDLX),"Thesis: Cardlytics ($CDLX)

Over the last two years, I have, with my own eyes, witnessed investors completely lose their cool with Cardlytics, often finding themselves on the wrong side of the trade. The next section describes my thesis, the current concerns, and the potential upside.

Cardlytics (NASDAQ: CDLX) distributes card-linked offers via bank channels. If your primary bank is a top bank in the US, such as Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Truist, or PNC, you will most likely have seen offers on display that where powered by Cardlytics. However, you will not encounter any Cardlytics branding. Banks incorporate the Automated Delivery Engine (ADE) of Cardlytics into their user interface (UI) across mobile and desktop apps.

This creates the impression for the user that these offers are natively served directly from the bank What might sound more familiar to you are names like Chase Offers, Bank Amerideals, or Well Fargo Rewards. These are branded names by the banks, but in reality, they’re powered by the ADE from Cardlytics.

From the consumer’s perspective, the card-linked offers (CLOs) are redeemed and credited as follows: The consumer begins by activating the offer within their bank app or on the bank’s website. They then use their linked debit or credit card to make a purchase at the specified merchant within the offer’s 45-day period. Once the transaction is complete, the cashback reward is automatically credited to their account. Essentially, Cardlytics is giving consumers free money through offers they cannot find elsewhere on the goods and services they buy every day.

During 2023, the Cardlytics platform analysed approximately $4.7 trillion in purchases across all categories and geographies, both online and in-store. This covers an incredible one in two of all purchase transactions in the US. They currently have over 168 million monthly active users (MAUs) in the banking channel who saved more than $144 million on purchased items through CLOs.

From the advertiser’s point of view, CLOs in the bank channel powered by Cardlytics are powerful:

1. Cardlytics distributes offers in a brand-safe, verified banking environment, ensuring fraud-free exposure.
2. Offers are targeted precisely based on consumers’ actual spending habits. Starbucks, for example, can reach customers who frequently shop at nearby cafes but rarely at Starbucks
3. Performance can be measured with pinpoint precision. Controlled randomized trials on the actual spending data give real-time insights in to campaign ROI
4. Advertisers benefit from strong returns, typically generating $4 to $6 in incremental revenue for every dollar spent.

For banks, Cardlytics delivers clear value by offering a share of advertising revenue. Banks receive just over half of what advertisers pay, net of the consumer incentives provided to customers.

More importantly, consumers who engage with Cardlytics CLOs are higher card spenders, have higher revolving card balances, interact more frequently with the bank’s app, and show reduced churn rates. Together, these benefits provide banks with value that far exceeds the revenue share alone.

Since the high in February 2021, Cardlytics has suffered a 97% decline in value. Such a dramatic decline illustrates two things: the inefficiency of the stock market and some past and current limitations associated with Cardlytics’ business model. To understand these past and present limitations, we need to dive deeper into the company’s technology stack, its founders, and how the management team has evolved over time.

The company’s founders were bankers who understood the power of historical purchase data and the needs of marketers. While skilled at building banking relationships and recognising the power of purchase intelligence, none of the founders were technical or product masterminds. This meant that for the first 14 years of the company’s existence, there was no tech leadership in place that could drive  the innovation needed to keep up with modern advertising standards.

The initial technology stack of Cardlytics comprised two on-premises solutions: the Offer Placement System (OPS), which was often hosted within each financial institution (FI) partner’s data infrastructure, and the Offer Management System (OMS), hosted separately by Cardlytics. Thi s structure created significant limitations.

OPS ran on individual bank servers, requiring custom configurations for each FI’s systems and security needs. This meant updates had to be installed separately at each location, making changes slow and resource-intensive.

OMS, hosted by Cardlytics, handled campaign management but relied on OPS for execution. Since each bank’s OPS operated independently, data collection was fragmented and couldn’t provide the real-time analytics that advertisers wanted.

Not only was Cardlytics limited by its software architecture, but the user interface of the CLOs was also fairly basic. Essentially, company logos were displayed with a specified cashback discount.

The old UI could not serve ads for specific categories or items (stock-keeping units, or SKUs). Offers simply displayed a percentage discount, which, while not a major issue for consumers, posed a significant challenge for smaller advertisers with less brand awareness.

Without the brand recognition of a typical Fortune 500 company, these smaller advertisers require more customisation to create excitement and engagement around the offers they aim to market.

The reasons for this limitation are two-fold: first, the simple UI did not allow for more advanced descriptions of the CLOs. Second, the bank data only captures where someone shopped, not what they bought.

Consequently, advertisers with differentiated margins, such as mass merchants (e.g., Costco), gas stations (e.g., Circle K), and hardware stores (e.g., Lowe’s), can only make limited use of the channel due to concerns that offers may be used by consumers to purchase low-margin items. Additionally, the inability to design offers around specific categories or SKUs prevents manufacturers (e.g., Campbell’s or Black & Decker) from utilising the channel. In some verticals, such as grocery, this is a severe limitation, as in those channels, manufacturers capture most of the margin and provide the majority of advertising and discounting.

Keeping these limitations in mind, we must note that Cardlytics’ growth has been impressive. Since its founding, the company has achieved cumulative revenue growth of over +20%, reaching $309M in revenue by the end of 2023.

Fast forward to today, and Cardlytics has undertaken significant efforts to address these limitations:

**First,** Cardlytics developed a new cloud-based ad server hosted on AWS, replacing the old on-premises solution previously maintained within each FI’s infrastructure. The AWS server centralises ad management, allowing updates, features, and security enhancements to be deployed universally across all FIs, significantly improving speed and efficiency. Its microservice architecture enables agile development and elastic scaling to handle demand fluctuations, ensuring a seamless user experience and optimised resource use. Additionally, the AWS environment enhances data processing capabilities and offers top-tier security, supporting fast, data-driven insights for advertisers.

Currently, only BofA, Cardlytics’ largest client, remains on the legacy server, creating some revenue distortion as this older setup requires special attention to maintain. Former CEO Karim Temsamani explained that migrating BofA involves substantial tech changes, as 20% of the network is still on- premises. Most banks have already moved to the new ad server with positive feedback, enabling faster updates moving forward. Once this technical debt is resolved, the company will be better positioned to drive incremental revenue growth.

**Second,** the company has positioned itself to offer highly customized, data-driven advertising with its acquisition of Bridg in 2021 for $350 million, plus a substantial additional earnout. Bridg offers  a powerful customer data platform that enables advertisers to link in-store purchases to individual profiles by integrating point-of-sale (POS) data with its proprietary cookieless identity resolution technology.

This technology uses a combination of non-personally identifiable payment details, third-party datasets, data from other Bridg clients, and artificial intelligence to match consumer transactions with unique email identifiers.

These email addresses allow Bridg to track customer behavior over time, even for those not in loyalty programs, and create detailed audience segments based on longitudinal behavior patterns.

This capability has significant potential when combined with Cardlytics' extensive data on consumer card spending. As part of Cardlytics, Bridg can now enhance its match rate by leveraging Cardlytics' transaction data, giving Cardlytics a sustainable competitive advantage in accurately identifying and segmenting audiences. Through Bridg’s integrations into merchants’ POS systems, Cardlytics can now deliver highly targeted, SKU-level offers directly to individual customers.

A practical example of Bridg’s impact is its work with Chipotle. By analyzing transaction data, Bridg enabled Chipotle to identify how specific menu items, like queso, influenced customer return rates. This insight allowed Chipotle to make data-backed adjustments to its menu, leading to improved customer retention and loyalty.

Now, Bridg’s granular customer tracking and segmentation capabilities extend to Cardlytics’ advertisers, enabling them to deploy SKU-specific offers that resonate with precise customer preferences.

The addition of SKU-level targeting is a game-changer for Cardlytics. It allows Cardlytics to tap into broader shopper marketing budgets from brands like Unilever and Procter & Gamble, who require SKU-level targeting capabilities for high-value, product-specific promotions. Early trials of SKU-specific offers, such as promoting Hershey’s products to U.S. Bancorp customers at Rite Aid, have shown promising results, and banks are optimistic about the impact of this advanced targeting.

By enabling precise, SKU-based targeting, Cardlytics is positioned to accelerate its growth trajectory, differentiate itself from competitors, and provide a suite of capabilities that are both complex and costly for others to replicate.

Third, leadership changes have presented a short-term challenge, with three CEO appointments in three years, highlighting the need for stability. Karim Temsamani, brought in from Stripe to focus on product development, ultimately did not meet expectations. Amit Gupta, former General Manager of Bridg, has now stepped in as CEO, bringing a solid technical background and a clear sense of leadership, making him a promising choice. An even more impactful change is the addition of Peter Chan as CTO.

With experience at Yahoo in the early 2000s, a period known for producing top engineering talent, Peter’s expertise significantly strengthens Cardlytics’ technical capabilities. As you can see, significant improvements have been happening at Cardlytics. Fortunately for us, these changes have yet to be reflected in the business’s stock price performance. In the next section, I’ll address why the stock has been trading in a $3–$20 range over the past two years.

Multiple narratives have been pushing the stock in all directions. When I first bought a stake, one issue was the uncertainty around the Bridg earnout payouts; this was essentially a disagreement between Cardlytics and the previous owners of Bridg. If Cardlytics had been wrong in its view on the dispute, the company could have technically gone bankrupt. This issue has since been resolved in favour of Cardlytics, and near-term liquidity is now sufficient. Once signs emerged that this would be settled, the stock quickly rose to around $19. However, it dropped back to $5 in early 2024, until the announcement of American Express joining the channel. This news was significant and drove the stock back up to $20. On the first day it reached $20, then-CEO Karim announced a 5% equity raise, sending the stock 33% lower, a decision that was both unnecessary and poorly timed.

Fast forward to Q1 and Q2, and new issues began to emerge. With the new ad engine, there was a dramatic increase in the over-delivery and under-delivery of ad campaigns. This has caused challenges for Cardlytics because when too many redemptions occur i.e., a campaign performs much better than expected and exceeds the initial budget set by the advertiser, Cardlytics must cover the difference. For example, if an advertiser sets a $1M budget, and the campaign generates $1.2M in activations, Cardlytics is responsible for paying the extra $200K. Conversely, when a campaign underperforms, there is no financial liability, but it damages the relationship with advertisers. This is budget they intended to spend that is now going unused.

The main reasons for these issues are twofold:

1. The old infrastructure did not support real-time tracking of engagement with any given campaign

2. This caused pricing to be structured differently, with Cardlytics offering a traditional media-buying pricing model.

Under the Cost per Served Sale (CPS) model, Cardlytics charges a percentage on purchases that users make from an advertiser only if they were served the offer during the campaign period and subsequently made a purchase. This model means Cardlytics earns revenue based on actual purchases that occur after an ad is served, tying revenue to a conversion (purchase) event, not just ad exposure.

The “over-delivery” issue can occur in CPS if more users engage with and redeem offers than the budget anticipated, thus triggering higher-than-expected Consumer Incentive payouts that Cardlytics must cover if the campaign budget is exceeded.

To make things worse, Cardlytics only realises these discrepancies over 60 days after the campaigns are launched. This obviously is not very scalable and leads to suboptimal business outcomes across all time frames.

The good news is that significant progress has been made. As is often the case, the best improvements come from facing challenges. For Cardlytics, this has been no different. The issues of under- and over-delivery have driven the team to build out engagement-based pricing and develop the Dynamic Marketplace.

The Dynamic Marketplace is central to the engagement-based pricing strategy, allowing advertisers to actively manage campaigns on a daily basis. Advertisers can now adjust Return on Ad Spend (ROAS) goals, fees, and budgets mid-campaign, addressing over- and under-delivery in near real-time. With over 20 campaigns live on this platform, the Dynamic Marketplace is transforming campaign management from a static, set-and-forget process to a responsive, performance-driven experience.

The shift to Cost per Engagement (CPE) aligns Cardlytics’ offerings with industry standards, making it easier for advertisers accustomed to CPC-based pricing on platforms like Google or Facebook to transition. This approach provides advertisers with the pacing, visibility, and control needed for efficient budget use, directly linking ad costs to specific, measurable consumer actions. According to CFO Alexis DeSieno, 38% of total billings are now on engagement-based pricing models, with a goal of moving the majority to CPE by the end of 2025.

Short-term earnings volatility should be expected, given that 62% of billings still come from static campaigns. The end of 2025 is probably ambitious, as Cardlytics has a history of under-delivering on deadlines it has set. I’m willing to give management the benefit of the doubt, and I’m curious to see if they can deliver this on time.

I hope this section has given you better insight into the past and current limitations of Cardlytics. It’s important to understand these, as it will allow you to cut through the noise more effectively when reading about the business.

Now that we’ve discussed challenges and limitations, it’s time to shift towards the strengths and expected value of Cardlytics.

Firstly, when considering competitive advantage, Cardlytics would be nearly impossible for individual banks to replicate. Banks would always have smaller MAUs compared to a distributor who aggregates the whole market, thereby significantly enhancing the quality of advertisers on the platform. Cardlytics spent over $180 million on the advertising platform in 2023, and this investment is set to increase from this point onwards.

You have to keep in mind that this is not a one-off; Cardlytics has been building this platform for the last 16 years. There is a compounding effect to all the investments they have made to date. These factors make it, in my view, extremely unlikely that banks would ever drop Cardlytics. Often, banking bureaucracy is seen as a weakness to the Cardlytics investment thesis. I see it as the opposite. While it may seem frustrating, it’s actually a significant competitive advantage. When a bank chooses a certain direction, they almost always stick to it, creating a substantial moat for Cardlytics. Additionally, this makes it very difficult for new players to enter this niche market.

Returning to the idea of banks replicating what Cardlytics has built. Given their reduced reach, less mature technology, and limited experience, a bank attempting to build its own ad network without Cardlytics would almost certainly end up with fewer offers on its system for many years, if not indefinitely. This lack of content would not only mean less revenue for the bank but, more importantly, fewer secondary benefits (such as retention and increased cardholder spending) that come with a robust collection of offers.

You’ll remember that these secondary benefits are multiple times more valuable to a bank than its revenue share. So, depending on how much less productive a bank’s standalone effort would be, it’s possible the bank could end up worse off, even without considering the direct costs of duplicating Cardlytics’ infrastructure.

It should also come as no surprise that Cardlytics has never lost a banking partner where the initiative came from the bank’s side. Given the amount of value the ecosystem holds for all participants, it’s hard to envision a scenario where Cardlytics’ business materially deteriorates in the long term. This means that our downside is naturally well protected from a business perspective. Cardlytics is certainly leveraged from a financial standpoint, but once the business reaches positive FCF and scale, these issues should resolve without substantial dilution on the equity side.

At maturity, Cardlytics should be able to generate 15–20% net income margins (or more if they succeed in reducing the bank partner share over time). At 20x profits, these margins would make the business worth 3–4x revenue. Based on today’s revenue, fair value would be $1.2 billion, which represents substantial upside. However, a scenario of no growth is very unlikely given the amount of runway and market share potential. Execution will be crucial, as will the evolution of the advertising marketplace over time.

These factors will ultimately determine whether Cardlytics becomes a $5 billion or $50 billion market cap company.

Currently, Cardlytics is selling for 0.60x revenue. This implies the market has no confidence in Cardlytics’ ability to grow, completely discounting all the factors mentioned in our analysis. When you go up against “Mr Market,” you need to have strong reasons to believe you’re right and the market is wrong.

In the case of Cardlytics, the volatility and complexity of the channel can discourage many investors. Given the short-term focus of most market participants, Cardlytics is a difficult stock to hold.

Progress may be slow or appear slow for extended periods. This naturally discourages investors, who tend to extrapolate the past into the future on a linear scale. This is a significant mistake when analysing Cardlytics. Progress in any business is rarely linear, and given the nature of Cardlytics, you can expect even more asymmetry.

Currently, there are multiple catalysts that could make the next 12 to 24 months look materially different:

1. Onboarding of American Express: Management has mentioned a small trial that went live this quarter, which is expected to scale into next year.
2. Integration of Bridg and increasingly targeted offers: New advertisers are joining the platform from categories that historically have not been served.
3. Improvement in macroeconomic conditions with a Trump administration, which, generally speaking, is expected to be pro-business with lower taxes and fewer regulations!
4. Rollout of a self-service platform, which will allow for a much broader advertiser base to onboard on the platform.
5. Implementation of engagement-based pricing, which will remove short-term headwinds and resolve issues of over- or under-delivering campaigns.
6. Full transition of all FI partners to the new ad server, creating an additional tailwind for revenue.
7. Expansion into the UK: Monzo has been onboarded, and Lloyds is currently Cardlytics’ largest customer. There is tremendous potential in the UK, which could significantly increase MAU.

Once these catalysts materialise, you can expect substantial changes to the stock price. I wouldn’t be surprised if these factors all come into play simultaneously. While the road to maturity will take many years and will have its ups and downs, you’re likely feeling quite optimistic about the prospects of an investment in Cardlytics by now.

Assuming our reasoning proves correct, Cardlytics should have many years of significant growth ahead. Currently, it represents over 30% of my investment portfolio. Following the latest earnings report, I have added to my existing position. Cardlytics is positioning itself for sustainable, asymmetric growth—but only time will tell.

WallStreetbetsELITE,Uber Illegal Strategies and Million Losses: Could They Ever Be Recovered?,"Hey guys, I've shared this a time ago, but in case you missed it, here is an article about Uber’s IPO scandal back in 2019 and how they’re solving this now:



[https://www.benzinga.com/markets/24/09/40755761/uber-from-ipo-hype-to-investor-fallout](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/24/09/40755761/uber-from-ipo-hype-to-investor-fallout)



Here is the TLDR: Uber’s May 2019 IPO was one of the most anticipated, positioning itself as a world-changing platform poised for multi-decade growth.



But by Q2 2019, things started to look shaky. Uber reported a massive $5 billion loss, with its slowest-ever revenue growth, raising serious concerns about its aggressive ""growth-at-any-cost"" strategy.



Regulatory troubles made things worse. Uber faced criticism for practices like classifying drivers as independent contractors instead of employees. On top of that, the company was accused of using software called “Greyball” to evade regulators and faced scrutiny in international markets like India and Brazil.



These issues, along with safety concerns—highlighted by over 3,000 reported safety incidents in 2018 alone—undermined investor confidence. By October 2019, just five months after its IPO, Uber’s stock had lost a third of its value, falling to around $30 per share. 



All these situations and controversies led investors to file a lawsuit, accusing Uber of misleading them about its risks and growth potential.



Fast forward to today, and Uber has already agreed to settle with a $200 million payout, and even if the deadline has passed, they’re accepting late claims. So, if you bought shares back then, you might be eligible to [file a claim](https://11thestate.com/cases/uber-investor-settlement) and recover some of your losses.



Now, the good news is that Uber has come a long way since those rocky early days. Under Khosrowshahi’s leadership, the company shifted focus to more sustainable growth and improving company culture. 



By 2023, Uber posted its first-ever annual operating profit of $1.1 billion and a net profit of $1.9 billion—a dramatic turnaround from the $9.1 billion loss it reported in 2022. The strategy has been about balancing growth with responsibility, and Wall Street seems to approve.



Anyways, do you think Uber can fully recover from its troubled IPO and become a long-term success story? And for those who held $UBER shares back then, how much did you lose?

WallStreetbetsELITE,Is ACHR unoffically ahead of others in the eVOTL space?,"Archer Aviation presents a compelling opportunity in the rapidly emerging eVTOL sector. While Joby Aviation has garnered attention with its larger market cap and high-profile investors like Toyota, Archer’s growth trajectory looks more favorable. Despite a smaller market cap, Archer’s aggressive path toward commercialization and impressive partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis position it well for future success. The company has built a solid foundation in both the airline and automotive industries, which, coupled with its $6 billion order book, demonstrates strong investor confidence and demand for its aircraft.  
  
What really sets Archer apart is its collaboration with Anduril, a cutting-edge defense technology company. This partnership not only helps Archer tap into the growing defense sector but also highlights the versatility of its aircraft, which could be used in military operations. Archer’s innovative approach, combined with its fast-growing commercial prospects, gives it a significant edge as it looks to scale quickly.  
  
In terms of valuation, Archer is more reasonably priced compared to Joby, which is currently valued at a premium despite a more sluggish revenue growth profile. Archer’s faster commercialization timeline and strong business fundamentals make it a more attractive investment option. As the eVTOL market continues to evolve, Archer’s blend of strategic alliances, rapid development, and reasonable valuation make it a standout choice for those looking to invest in the future of urban air mobility.",['TM'],10,6,5,2025-02-03 17:25:16+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/WallStreetbetsELITE/comments/1iguh3d/is_achr_unoffically_ahead_of_others_in_the_evotl/,0.992

WallStreetbetsELITE,Trump just signed orders imposing the tariffs,"Reporting now from the NYT: [https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/02/01/us/trump-tariffs-news](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/02/01/us/trump-tariffs-news)

Article without paywall:

President Trump on Saturday followed through with his threat to impose stiff tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China, setting the stage for a destabilizing trade war with the United States’ largest commercial partners.

From Mar-a-Lago, in Palm Beach, Fla., Mr. Trump signed three executive orders placing tariffs of 25 percent on all goods from Canada and Mexico, with a slightly lower 10 percent tariff on Canadian oil exports. Mr. Trump also placed a 10 percent tariff on Chinese goods.

A White House official told reporters on Saturday that the executive orders would also contain a retaliation clause, so that if a country tried to retaliate with tariffs on U.S. products, it would face tariffs.

Ordinarily, tariffs are used to correct a market imbalance, particularly if a country is subsidizing its exports. But these levies are aimed at pressuring Canada and Mexico to end the flow of migrants and drugs into the country, as well as punishing China for its role in the fentanyl trade. At various moments Mr. Trump has declared that he is not interested in negotiating over the tariffs, and that companies that want to avoid them should move their manufacturing to the United States.

The move will raise the cost of doing business with the United States’ three largest trading partners, and it could mark the beginning of an economically painful trade war. Canada, Mexico and China account for more than a third of U.S. imports, providing cars, medicine, shoes, timber, electronics, steel and many other products to American consumers. Mr. Trump and other White House officials have deflected the criticism that the tariffs will add to inflation.

The countries have also promised to answer Mr. Trump’s levies with tariffs of their own [on U.S. exports](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/17/world/canada/canada-trump-tariffs.html). Canada has indicated it will tax Florida orange juice, Tennessee whiskey and Kentucky peanut butter. The decision to hit those products, at least initially, is strategic: They come from states with Republican Senators and with voters who elected Mr. Trump in 2024.

While Mr. Trump’s announcement was signaled in advance, it came before he held any of type of serious negotiations with leaders of the three countries. President Claudia Sheinbaum of Mexico emphasized on Friday that her country should proceed with a “cool head” and a plan to retaliate. Canada’s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said on Friday that his nation was prepared to respond if Mr. Trump took action.

Some business owners praised Mr. Trump’s decision for the impact it would have on U.S. manufacturers.

Zach Mottl, the president of Atlas Tool Works, a metal manufacturer near Chicago, called the tariffs “a bold and necessary step toward reversing decades of failed trade policies and rebuilding America’s manufacturing and agricultural industries.”

Mr. Mottl, who is also the chairman of Coalition for Prosperous America, a group that supports tariffs, said in an interview that his factory had struggled, and that he had seen many suppliers and customers go out of business in recent decades from foreign competition.

“A universal tariff is a great way to generate revenue and to kick-start job growth in America,” he said.

But others said the tariffs could be harmful for many companies that depend on international supply chains. John G. Murphy, a senior vice president at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said that the tariffs would cause “severe harm to many U.S. manufacturers” and were “a recipe for decline.”

Many imports are materials, inputs and equipment used by U.S. manufacturers that often are not available from U.S. sources, Mr. Murphy said.

There is also little slack in the U.S. economy now, he added, meaning that not many workers are available and willing to do the low-wage assembly work that manufacturers have moved to countries like Mexico.

The economic consequences of tariffs could be crippling for Canada and Mexico, which send roughly 80 percent of their exports to the United States and are more economically dependent on trade than the United States is.

The Canadian and Mexican governments have been scrambling in recent weeks to forestall the tariffs by reassuring the Trump administration about their efforts to police the border and stop the drug trade. Canadian and Mexican officials have also said they will respond to any U.S. tariffs with levies of their own.

Chrystia Freeland, Canada’s former finance minister, wrote in a social media post on Friday that Canada should target Tesla, which is owned by Elon Musk, a close adviser to Mr. Trump.

“We must hit back — dollar for dollar — starting with 100 percent tariffs on all Tesla vehicles and U.S. wine, beer, and spirits,” she wrote. “We must protect Canadian workers and businesses.”

Ms. Sheinbaum told reporters on Friday that the Mexican government had been working for months on a plan to react to possible tariffs. “We are prepared for any scenario,” she said.

Though Mr. Trump is hitting Canada and Mexico alike, the situation at the United States’ northern border is quite different from that at the southern border.

Last year, U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents [intercepted](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/30/world/canada/canada-fentanyl-trump.html)about 19 kilograms of fentanyl at the northern border, compared with almost 9,600 kilograms at the border with Mexico, where [cartels mass-produce the drug](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/29/world/americas/inside-fentanyl-lab-mexico.html).

At both borders, the number of illegal crossings has also dropped sharply in recent months, after skyrocketing in late 2023 and 2024. In December, agents made roughly 47,000 arrests at the southern border and 510 at the northern border.

Tariffs are a particular affront to Canada and Mexico because the countries have long had a free-trade agreement with the United States, including one that the president signed during his first term. The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which Mr. Trump negotiated to replace NAFTA, is supposed to allow goods to flow tariff-free across North America.

The USMCA does provide an exception for governments to act to address issues of national security, and the Trump administration could claim that the border issue is one.

The tariffs will be particularly painful given that more than 30 years under a free-trade agreement has made the U.S., Canadian and Mexican economies highly integrated.

Supply chains producing cars, clothing, packaged food and other goods have been built to snake back and forth across North America’s borders. And many goods produced in factories in Canada and Mexico are made with parts or raw materials from the United States, compounding the potential for tariffs to negatively affect the U.S. economy.

In [a government filing](https://www.regulations.gov/comment/USTR-2023-0013-0017) last year, for example, a trade group that represents General Motors, Ford and Stellantis said that on average, 50 percent of the content of a vehicle built in Canada came from the United States. For Mexico, the proportion was 35 percent, it said.

Importers bringing goods into the country from Canada, Mexico and China will immediately be subject to the additional cost of a tariff. They will have to choose whether to pass those costs on to American consumers in the form of higher prices.

Many economists expect them to do so, at least in part. That could be particularly painful for Americans, at a time when many are already concerned about the cost of groceries, gasoline and other goods.

James Knightley, the chief international economist at ING, warned that consumers on the lower-end of the income spectrum would face the biggest burden from higher tariffs. That is because those households tend to spend more of their income on physical goods relative to higher-income households, which disproportionately spend more on services and experiences.

Assuming that Americans do not substitute higher-priced items and that consumers bear the cost entirely, Mr. Knightley said, the tariffs would translate to a $835 hit per person in the United States, or $3,342 for a family of four. Working families, he said, look “particularly vulnerable.”

Beyond the cost to households, economists also worry about broader effects on economic growth, warning that trade tensions will probably lead to less investment and more subdued business activity.

Researchers at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington [estimate](https://www.piie.com/blogs/realtime-economics/2025/trumps-threatened-tariffs-projected-damage-economies-us-canada-mexico) that a 25 percent tariff on all exports from Mexico and Canada would hit those countries the hardest, but would slow economic growth and accelerate inflation in all three countries.

Mr. Trump has not been persuaded by those arguments. He has long boasted of the value of tariffs as a way to generate revenue, boost U.S. manufacturing and cow foreign governments into action. Speaking to reporters from the Oval Office on Friday, Mr. Trump suggested this was just the beginning of his trade war.

The president said he would also “absolutely” impose tariffs on the European Union, saying that it had “treated us so terribly.” He added that the United States would eventually put tariffs on chips, oil and gas — “I think around the 18th of February,” he said — as well as later levies on steel, aluminum and copper.

Mr. Trump’s top economic advisers, as well as his newly appointed Treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, and his choice for Commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, have pushed back on the idea that U.S. consumers will suffer as a result of tariffs.

Speaking before the Senate in a confirmation hearing last week, Mr. Lutnick maintained that a particular product’s price might go up but that the notion of tariffs causing broader inflation was “nonsense.”

“The economy of the United States of America will be much, much better,” he said.","['TSLA', 'TSLA']",542,358,175,2025-02-01 22:42:53+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/WallStreetbetsELITE/comments/1ifiisr/trump_just_signed_orders_imposing_the_tariffs/,0.9856

# Quantum computer learning, education, news:

My obsession with quantum computing began after the quantum crash—a moment sparked by Jensen Huang and Mark Zuckerberg's comments. I struggled to find reliable information, so I set out on a quest for knowledge.

Despite competing headlines in today's news, and lopsided coverage toward negative press, quantum technology is advancing rapidly, and we are on the brink of major breakthroughs. This momentum led me to create The Quantum Bull—a platform dedicated to teaching, informing, and inspiring others about quantum computing.

1 NYSE uplisting on the horizon - More exposure, better liquidity, and institutional money in play.

2 AI-powered gaming integration - OneMeta’s real-time AI translation could reshape global gaming, supporting 140+ languages for platforms like Xbox & PlayStation.

3 AI for call centers - Already powering real-time multilingual customer support for industry leaders like Five9, Genesys, and NICE.

WallStreetbetsELITE,🚀 Bullish Case for Take-Two Interactive (TTWO) 🚀 Earnings Play 🚀,"# Expected 5-15% Price Surge Due to Upcoming Earnings and GTA6 Announcement!

🌟 **The perfect opportunity to invest now and profit from a potential price surge!** 🌟

Take-Two Interactive has consistently proven to be a market leader in the gaming industry. But now, **GTA6 is coming**, and the hype could **skyrocket TTWO's stock price** to a whole new level. **Are you ready for the next big move?** Here’s why you should act **now**!

# 🎮 GTA6 Announcement: A Megaphone for TTWO's Stock Price 🎮

GTA6 is the **most anticipated game of all time**—the gaming community worldwide is excited, and this **directly impacts TTWO's stock price**.

💥 **The date that could change everything: September 17, 2025** (The same release date as GTA5 in 2013)  
💥 **Why now is the perfect time**: The announcement of **GTA6's release date** and the **potential trailer release** could push TTWO's stock **up to 15% in the coming weeks**.

➡️ **Remember:** When **GTA5** was announced in **2011**, **Take-Two's stock jumped 12% within days**—equivalent to an increase of approximately **$2.5 billion in market capitalization!**

Now, with the **GTA6 hype even bigger**, we expect a **similar or even stronger price surge**! This is a **once-in-a-lifetime moment** to **buy options and profit from the upcoming price boom!**

# 💡 The Facts:

# GTA6 – The Game of Games:

✅ **GTA6 is one of the most anticipated releases in gaming history** and could significantly drive Take-Two’s stock price leading up to its release.  
✅ **Social media communities** on **Reddit, Twitter, and TikTok** discuss GTA6 daily, fueling hype and media attention.  
✅ **GTA5 catapulted Take-Two’s market capitalization by over $2 billion in 2013.** With GTA6, expectations are even higher—and this could send TTWO’s price **exploding!**

# 🔥 GTA6 Leak and the September 17 Release Date

An **Instagram account named Xuruguay**—which collaborates closely with Sony—recently **leaked the GTA6 release date (September 17, 2025)**, immediately sparking **massive speculation across Twitter, Reddit, and other platforms**.

This date **exactly matches GTA5’s release date in 2013**, making it seem **very credible**. However, the leak was **quickly debunked**.

📌 **Important:**

* **According to** [**beebom.com**](http://beebom.com) **(source link), the leak was called fake.**
* **However, Xuruguay is closely tied to Sony, and their apology could just be a “fake apology”** to cover up the real date.
* **There’s no confirmed link between Xuruguay and Take-Two Interactive,** so this should be taken with caution.
* **But why would Xuruguay post this?** They **gained no sales or profit** from it, suggesting it was either **a publicity stunt or an honest mistake**.

# 😂 GTA6 Memes and Jokes

Who doesn’t know the classic joke? **""Even this happened before GTA6 was released.""**

* Social media users **constantly** joke about GTA6’s delay, turning it into an **internet phenomenon**.
* **Even political and economic news is met with jokes about GTA6's non-release.**
* **This level of hype keeps GTA6 constantly in the conversation,** ensuring high engagement and speculation.

# 🛑 Inconsistency in the September 17 Release Date

There is **one major inconsistency** with the **GTA6 September 17 release theory**: Rockstar usually **releases its games on a Tuesday or Friday**.

|**Game**|**Release Date**|**Day of the Week**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**GTA5**|Sep 17, 2013|**Tuesday**|
|**GTA4**|Apr 29, 2008|**Tuesday**|
|**GTA: San Andreas**|Oct 26, 2004|**Tuesday**|

🔴 **September 17, 2025, is a Wednesday!**  
This would be the **first time in GTA history** that a major game **releases on a Wednesday**, which contradicts Rockstar’s usual release patterns.  
**Could this mean Xuruguay’s leak was false, and the actual release date is later in September or October 2025?**

# 📈 Take-Two Interactive’s Fundamentals

Take-Two Interactive (TTWO) is **more than just a gaming company**. It is a **global leader** with a **strong financial base**:

✅ **Current stock price**: **$188.71**  
✅ **Market capitalization**: Over **$20 billion**  
✅ **P/E ratio**: Historically around **40.82** (a sign of strong growth potential)  
✅ **Revenue growth**: Consistently strong, driven by GTA V, Red Dead Redemption 2, and NBA 2K.  
✅ **Future outlook**: Take-Two has enormous **growth potential** with GTA6 and future releases.

# 📅 Recent Earnings Calls and Stock Reactions

Here’s a **breakdown of the last 6 earnings calls** and **how TTWO’s stock reacted:**

WallStreetbetsELITE,"Apple earnings top Wall Street forecasts while iPhone, China sales fall short","Apple's fiscal Q1 earnings exceeded expectations, with the company posting earnings per share of $2.40 and revenue of $124.3 billion, surpassing the consensus estimates of $2.35 and $124.1 billion. While the overall numbers were positive, iPhone sales slightly missed Wall Street's projections, bringing in $69.1 billion compared to the expected $71 billion. Additionally, the company's sales in Greater China were lower than anticipated, totaling $18.5 billion against an expected $21.5 billion. This decline in China, part of a longer trend, reflects challenges like currency fluctuations and weaker demand for iPhones and iPads in the region.

Despite these setbacks, Apple's Services division performed well, generating $26.3 billion, meeting expectations. The company also continues to focus on its growing AI efforts, with the release of Apple Intelligence software updates aimed at encouraging iPhone upgrades, though analysts have expressed concerns about whether the updates will have the impact Apple hopes for. Meanwhile, Apple’s overall iPhone market share fell 1% year over year in Q4, though the broader smartphone market grew by 3%.

Apple's stock has risen 24% over the past year, keeping pace with competitors like Google (up 27%) but trailing behind Nvidia, which surged by 102%. Despite the challenges in Greater China and some slower growth in iPhone sales, Apple is expected to continue driving innovation with new products, including an updated iPhone SE, new iPads, and MacBook Airs. These efforts, alongside their expanding AI capabilities, will likely shape the company’s trajectory in the coming months.

WallStreetbetsELITE,Missed PLTR the next big opporunity UiPath (PATH),"**Why I Bought Shares in UiPath (PATH)**

Automation and AI-driven workflows aren’t just the future they’re the now. UiPath ($PATH) is the undisputed leader in robotic process automation (RPA), giving businesses the tools to automate everything from data entry to complex enterprise workflows. With companies racing to cut costs and improve efficiency, automation is a must-have, not a luxury.

Unlike traditional enterprise software companies (think SAP, Oracle, or ServiceNow), UiPath is pure-play automation, focusing 100% on scaling AI-driven efficiency across industries. As AI becomes smarter and more deeply embedded into workflows, UiPath is positioned to own this transformation.

**Financial Overview:**

**Market Capitalization:** $7.91 billion – relatively small for a category leader in a multi-trillion-dollar automation market.  
**Revenue Growth:** $1.31 billion in 2023 (+23.57% YoY) – growing steadily even as the broader tech sector cools down.  
**Cash Reserves:** $1.57 billion in cash, with only $81.60 million in debt a fortress balance sheet compared to cash-burning startups.  
**Net Income:** \-$89.88 million in 2023 (but improving **by 72.63% YoY) –** a clear path to profitability.

**TLDR:** Strong revenue growth, improving margins, and no existential debt risk.

Strategic Developments:

**Agentic AI is the next evolution of automation.**  
90% of IT executives believe AI-driven automation can improve business efficiency, and 77% are ready to invest in it this year. UiPath’s AI-powered workflows and autonomous software bots aren’t just replacing human work—they’re enhancing decision-making and unlocking new productivity levels.

**Competitive Edge:**

* Unlike Blue Prism or Automation Anywhere, UiPath has deep AI integrations and a broader enterprise footprint.
* Competes with Microsoft’s Power Automate, but unlike Microsoft, UiPath is platform-agnostic and works seamlessly across different enterprise stacks.
* Expanding cloud-based automation offerings, reducing deployment friction for businesses.

**Analyst Ratings & Price Target:**

Current Wall Street Consensus: *Hold* (but when has Wall Street ever been ahead of the curve? 🤡)  
12-Month Price Target: $15.44 (7.22% upside), with bull cases targeting $20+ as AI adoption accelerates.  
Institutional Ownership: Major hedge funds and institutions are quietly adding shares while retail is sleeping.

UiPath already dominates enterprise automation. As AI and automation merge, companies will either use UiPath or get left behind. With a solid balance sheet, a clear growth runway, and AI tailwinds, this is a long-term asymmetric bet. $PATH","['ORCL', 'MSFT', 'MSFT']",0,3,3,2025-01-30 01:23:09+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/WallStreetbetsELITE/comments/1idaig0/missed_pltr_the_next_big_opporunity_uipath_path/,0.974

WallStreetbetsELITE,I’m spooning a Barrett .50 cal - ACHR,"Am I missing something??

1. Archer has MVP and has shown video in flight
2. Other eVTOL companies are pooping the bed:
Airbus
Lilium 
Volocopter
Rolls Royce/advanced air mobility
3. Archer is already expanding into the UAE and India
4. Archer already has contracts with Anduril /US military 
5. Joby seems to be the most likely significant rival to Archer but the size of the expected market can certainly more than one player
6. Archer cash on hand is reported to be around $0.5B
7. TAM for military stealth operations reported at $45B (Don Valentine: “Target big markets!”). And you know Hegseth is going to look to tech for military hegemony. 
8. Sales are projected to start later this year, with partners already signed:
United Airlines
Stellantis
2PointZero (Abu Dhabi investment holding company)
9. Boeing/Wisk settled with Archer with no other major litigation ongoing
10. Everyone just got ass blasted/blasted in the ass on AI/deepSeek and needs somewhere to run. 


The Archer Midnight is a real and working solution to a real problem. Short urban flights are necessary and people will definitely use them once the economics are workable.

Why isn’t everyone jumping in on archer right now??

WallStreetbetsELITE,Can You Really Get Paid for Recommending Products You Love?,"In the ever-evolving world of social media, consumers have become key players in shaping brand narratives. What was once a space dominated by sponsored posts from celebrities and influencers is now transforming into a more democratized ecosystem where everyday users have the power to generate income by simply sharing their favorite products online. But how does this model work, and can you actually earn money by recommending the things you love? Let’s dive into the concept and highlight an innovative platform that’s disrupting the digital advertising landscape: **Thumzup Media Corporation (NASDAQ: TZUP).**

**The Peer-to-Peer Advertising Revolution**

Social media advertising is undergoing a fundamental shift. Traditionally, brands paid top influencers hefty sums to promote their products. However, this approach often lacked the authenticity consumers crave. Enter the new era of peer-to-peer advertising—a model where regular users create organic, trustworthy recommendations for their network of friends and followers. This shift has opened doors for social media users to earn money through platforms that incentivize sharing, creating a new wave of income opportunities within the gig economy.

Platforms that operate in this space typically bridge the gap between advertisers and everyday social media users. Here’s how it generally works:

1. **Users Sign Up**: Participants create an account on an advertising platform designed for peer-to-peer promotion.
2. **Choose Brand Campaigns**: Users select from available campaigns to promote products or services that align with their interests.
3. **Share and Earn**: By posting branded content on their social media channels, users earn direct payments or incentives based on engagements or set compensation per post.

Meticulously curated financial data, ingested \~200k+ SEC filings across last decade and more than 1000 PDFs of top finance books across investing, trading etc. It took 10+ iterations, multiple model trainings and 24+ months to arrive at where I am and finally felt vindicated to see that ""Deep Pockets i.e OpenAI or Nvidia"" doesn't always win and there is space for new comers.

WallStreetbetsELITE,"Not sure why there’s panic regarding Deepseek. If anything, it just showcased the massive potential AI has.","People have been desperate to look for ways to make inference cheap. It is much cheaper now.

It’s open source. Any one can adopt it, and run it locally “completely safe and private”.

Can’t comment on the future of deepseek, but it seems like they care about open source so likely the next set of their models will be open source too.

It’s not like AI is done and this is the peak performance people desire. There’s more to go. Not only that, it’s now possible for smaller labs/groups to build the SOTA. It’s  also great for bigger labs because it means more ablations.

In terms of Compute, bigger models are still required. Deepseek is fantastic in terms of cost. But it’s still only as good as the other models. True, benchmarks are flawed, but it hasn’t exactly shattered them in terms of raw performance. So there’s definitely a need to improve. That can only happen with bigger models or more training. That literally means the requirement of more GPUs.

GPUs are also needed to generate good data. More and more research shows internet data is not enough, data needs to be generated. How does that happen? GPUs. Whether Nvidia or not is a separate story. But someone needs to come in here.

WallStreetbetsELITE,DeepSeek as China’s Trojan Horse to Undermine U.S. AI Giants,"It turns out the Chinese AI model was trained on ChatGPT’s responses—some of its outputs are nearly identical, and when asked “Who are you?”, it even replied, “I’m ChatGPT, created by OpenAI” 😂. Add to that:

* massive amounts of citizen data collected by the Chinese government,
* Chinese students scattered across Western companies quietly collaborating with the government,
* legions of government hackers specialized over decades in stealing technology from Western firms,
* unlimited government funding for AI (just the hardware, smuggled illegally from Nvidia, probably cost at least $2 billion),
* and government policies pushing millions of students into technical universities (and with numbers like that, some hidden gems are bound to emerge).

And then they made DeepSeek open source and are aggressively marketing it as a “small, cheap project by a hobbyist nerd” to make global investors doubt the big U.S. AI companies and slow down the cash flow. That also helps curb the U.S. vacuuming up the world’s top AI specialists.

WallStreetbetsELITE,LET ME CUT THROUGH THE DEEPSEEK FUD AND GIVE YOU THE REALITY AS I SEE IT.  (I've done a ton of research on this and feel well informed in my opinion here),"Firstly, I will say that the LLM Deepseek has produced is extremely impressive, and IS a significant competitor to the products produced at OpenAI and at META, and Open source at that.

However, some of the claims being made out of China on Deepseek are highly unrealistic. 

Firstly, the fact that they claim their model cost only $6M to produce. 

This has raised significant eyebrows on Wallstreet and is basically why the mag7 names are all down today. After all, the MAg7 names have spent hundreds of billions in CAPEX towards their AI efforts. Now we are saying that a small Chinese company has produced the leading LLM for just $6M. It would appear then that the Mag7 companies including Microsoft and Meta have been highly inefficient. 

Of course, this is naturally a major hyperbole. $6M is literally laughable in the face of the hundreds of billions spent at OpenAI to develop ChatGPT. I mean yes, I admit that the MAG7 firms have been somewhat inefficient in their spending. Zuckerberg and Sundar both have admitted to the fact that they have overspent on AI, but to the extent that $6M is all they needed, is totally ridiculous. 

Understand this, a few weeks ago, Mark Zuckerberg was on Joe Rogan’s podcast. He literally discussed Deepseek there. He admitted that it was ‘A very advanced model’, and presumably he knew about the supposed cost efficiency of DeepSeek. Fast forward 2 weeks, and META increases CAPEX by over a third to power AI ambitions. Do you think Zuckerberg is stupid? He must be, to try out a much cheaper Chinese model, see the benefits of it, and instead of being worried that he’s overspent on CAPEX, he instead increases CAPEX further. Something there doesn’t add up right? And we are talking about one of the brightest brains in tech. Clearly he either knows that that $6M is total bullshit, or his CAPEX goals are towards something much much more than just an LLM like what Deepseek has built (I will come onto this point). 

Now let’s consider this from another angle. Supposedly, the CCP knows that they have, in Deepseek, a world leading LLM which cost just $6M. They would then realise the fact that AI can be done much more cheaply than the hundreds of billions of dollars that the US are throwing at it. Why the hell, then, would they announce a 1 trillion yen ($137B) funding plan to support their AI needs. I mean, surely that would be totally wasteful. $6M for the deepseek built. $137B funding plan. Makes no sense right, when you think about it?

Let’s then go onto the other claim that Deepseek makes that seems highly unlikely. This is the fact that they claim they did not have access to any of the high power NVDA chips. These are the very expensive Chips that the US companies have all built their AI models on. If true, it would be highly impressive that Deepseek has managed this without needing these leading chips, which may point to the fact that these Leading NVDA chips are actually pretty redundant. Again, it would point to the fact that these American firms have massively overspent on their AI needs. 

And secondly, it would point to the fact that US export controls haven’t done much to hold China back, because they are still innovating better than US firms, even WITHOUT the high power H100 Nvidia Chips. 

Firstly, it would seem highly unlikely that they have managed this build with the much older Nvidia chips. Scale AI CEO made comments over the weekend that it is common knowledge that Deepseek actually DO have high power Nvidia H100 chips. And they have a shit ton of them. 50,000 is the claim that he made. This may be overstated potentially, but what’s clear is that they likely DO have H100 chips. They just cannot admit to having them due to the fact that they are supposed to be subject to GPU export controls. 50,000 H100s would put them at the scale of Tesla btw, and would make that $6M figure totally impossible. 

Frankly, the fact that they would have these H100 chips seems highly likely. Deepseek is owned by a partner company which is a Quant firm, which was documented buying H100 chips before the export ban came in, so it would make sense that they have access to these high power chips that they are claiming not to. 

Why would they be lying then? 

Well, 2 very good reasons:

1) to convince American policymakers that GPU export controls have been ineffective at impeding Chinese AI

2) to entice foreign investors & international attention, which will in turn accelerate the development of Chinese AI

And by the way, the Chinese have a very long history of exaggerating their claims on Technology. You can look up any of the following as an example of this:

*  ""Brain-reading"" AI
*  The ""three-second battery""
*  Quantum satellite ""Micius""
*  Faster-than-light communications
*  Hongxin Semiconductor (HSMC)
*  Jiaolong Submersible
* Tokamak Reactor

So the fact that China would lie about this is nothing new at all. 

Even if we were to take Deepseek totally at face value. So they have produced a highly efficient LLM at very low Capex. FINE. Do you think these Mag7 firms’ end goal is LLMs? No way at all. The end goal is AGI guys. That’s what their CAPEx spending is going towards. That’s what the billions of dollars being spent and all the AI infrastructure is for. That’s what the race is towards. And even with LLMs, there is a LONG way to go to get to AGI. And AGIs WILL require a lot of heavy computing chips. And Deepseek claims they don’t have them. Even if they do have them, they and China will likely need many many more to reach AGI. And the US can restrict these chips more stringently to handicap China in their push towards what is the final end goal, AGI. 

So even if true, Deepseek would be highly impressive, yes, but does not mean that the MAg7 firms have wasted their CAPEX and have been beaten. Not at all, as the race is still very much ongoing towards the end goal. Commoditzation of LLMs is already known by everyone to be inevitable. That’s why META has gone open source already on their Llama. This is not what the mag7 firms want. They want fully fledged AGI. 

Okay now let’s look at some of the bear claims here for individual companies. 

Firstly, Meta. Many are making the argument that Deepseek has proven itself to be more effective than Llama, and so Llama becomes redundant. Not really, that’s not how I see it at all. I see Deepseek as a massive validation for META that they are on the right tracks with their Llama project, and their ambition for creating n open source LLM. Deepseek has shown the value of this, as developers can come in and upgrade the code basically. More and more people will see the benefit in this open source, and will want it. And META are the guys who are delivering that in the US. 

As META Chief AI scientist said over the weekend, “deepseek has profited from open research and open source/ They came up with new ideas and built on top of other people’s work. Because their work is published and open source, everyone can profit form it. That’s the power of open source. Deepseek is a victory for open source”. 

That last line is the tell. Deepseek is a victory for open source. What is META’s Llama. Open source. Do the maths, it’s a victory for META in reality. 

The bigger FUD, however, is for NVIDIA. Some are calling this the Nvidia killer.

Let’s look at the bear’s claims. They claim that wow, Deepseek produced their LLM without even needing Nvidia chips. It means that Nvidia H100 and Blackwell chips are NOT necessary, which will lead to much lower demand. Furthermore, they argue that these US AI firms have MASSIVELY overspent on CAPEX, and will be beaten out by MUCH MUCH more efficient firms like Deepseek. This will eventually lead them out of business, which will flood the second hand market with Nvidia chips, which will reduce the price and appeal of the chips. 

The other argument is that if AI can be done SO much more efficiently, then it will by definition of being more efficient, require LESS chips to power it than previously thought. As such, Nvidia demand may have been massively overstated to date. 

Let’s look at this first point then. Well, if we add in the most likely fact of the matter, that Deepseek DID have Nvidia H100 chips, and a ton of them at that, then it defuncts the argument that you can produce this kind of AI model WIHTOUT needing Nvidia chips. The reality is, that you DO need Nvidia chips. And even Deepseek needed these Nvidia chips. So there is no real issue for the future demand of Nvidia chips. 

Seocndly, the fact that these US AI firms will go out of business. Well, No. Why would they? As I mentioned, they are working towards AGI. Suggesting they have been outdone by Deepseek is to suggest their end goal was LLMs. I have already argued to you that this was NOT their end goal. 

Then the last point, That less Chips will be needed if Ai can be done more efficnelty. 

Well, No. Even if we suggest that AI CAN be done more efficiently than first thought, if we consider Jevon’s Paradox, we realise that this would STILL mean that we will use MORE AI chips rather than less. 

Consider it with the following examples. 

Think about batteries. One may think that as batteries became more efficient, fewer batteries would be needed to power our electronics. But that’s not what happened. As batteries became more efficient, more and more electricals started using Batteries. And the demand for batteries went up. 

Think about farming equipment for instance. One may argue that as more efficient farming technology came about, perhaps less would be needed. Well, not really. As it got more efficient, it led to more and more farming, which increased the demand for farming equipment.

This idea is Jevon’s paradox. The idea that as something gets more effcient, the demand for it actually increases. 

And we can see that with AI. If AI becomes more efficient, and more cost effective then, it becomes more accessible to the masses. Which will increase the roll out of AI, which will, on aggregate, increase the demand for AI infrastructure such as chips. 

So Nvidia chips will NOT lose out from this. It will actually WIN from this. 

As such, I do not buy into the idea that Deepseek is any fundamental risk to Nvidia or META or the other Mag7 firms. We can see some weak initial price action as many will buy into the FUD that’s being spread online. But the reality is that the long term future of these companies is largely unaffected by Deepseek. Firstly, Deepseek has massively exaggerated their claims. Secondly, the fact that Deepseek has produced this efficient LLM, does not compromise the MAg7 end goal, and actually should Increase Nvidia demand by Jevon’s paradox. ","['META', 'MSFT', 'META', 'META', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'TSLA', 'META', 'META', 'META', 'META', 'META', 'META', 'META', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'META', 'NVDA']",1311,225,166,2025-01-27 09:28:01+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/WallStreetbetsELITE/comments/1ib4ds7/let_me_cut_through_the_deepseek_fud_and_give_you/,0.9982
WallStreetbetsELITE,Thoughts on BABA?,"Post got clapped in r/StocksAndTrading 2 days ago. Not sure why. Anyway...

BABA is one of the biggest tech companies in China driving most cash transactions and is one of the main 2 ways to make payments there (and in some other parts of the world), they also run a small business called TaoBao. Not a DD at all but I have some good reasons for going into BABA a week ago and yesterday was a strong backing in my belief. I didn't buy in at all-time lows (87 a share) but it hit 89 yesterday, breaking the resistance at 87.3. Here are the juicy findings I have.

https://preview.redd.it/35znlsdtc2fe1.png?width=1409&format=png&auto=webp&s=93fbd83f523018e460e3eebbaef562d38bbf4e47

1. Tariffs against China was priced in somewhere at 60-200% but it was reported 10% expectation from the Davos forum. This is far below expectations and a strong driving force for the Chinese market in general. Yes, you are thinking ""but BABA is 80% local, 20% foreign invested - tariffs shouldn't even be a big factor anyways"", then
2. Due to the recent migration of users from TikTok to XHS, the highest searches on the XHS platform have turned from cat memes to ""tourism in China"" and ""what to do in China"". There is a strong sentimental shift in people's opinions of China and it is starting to fruit even in the US. Stores are selling out of eggs and Asian aisles are clearing up. This is going to lead to a lot of interest in travel and tourism into China (and for someone who has just returned from Hang Zhou, shit there is cheap and very good). This will then lead to a higher dependency on AliPay for payments.
3. Even for financials, BABA has a forward PE ratio of 8.98, shy that of other tech companies like AAPL (30+), NVDA (50+) and TSLA (100+). BABA EPS $4.87, AAPL $6.07, NVDA $2.54 and TSLA $3.65.
4. Competition-wise, BABA has many competitors in China for its e-commerce such as PDD and JD but it is still the biggest player right now. And in terms of payment services, there is only really AliPay and WeChat Pay, with the latter being listed in the HKSE and not in the USSE's. Most things in China can ONLY be paid with either of these two services. I have personally used AliPay for public transport, ""Uber"", food, lodging, e-commerce, etc, even down to street stalls. In fact, even street beggars provide their QR codes to collect cash from people.
5. The market has completely forgotten about BABA ever since its collapse in Oct 2020 and it has a short interest of just 1.57% right now. In my opinion, the quiet does give it a very interesting edge in loading more shares over time. To add, everyone's favourite regard, Michael Burry, is also 25.55% invested into BABA in his Scion Asset Management portfolio.",['UBER'],1,2,2,2025-01-27 02:31:44+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/WallStreetbetsELITE/comments/1iaxhy4/thoughts_on_baba/,0.9831

WallStreetbetsELITE,Lantronix (LTRX): Working with Coca-Cola and other news from this month’s conferences,"Let’s start with what we already knew about Lantronix, a company that was already positioned to thrive:

•	NetComm Acquisition: This added 5G capabilities and expanded their geographic footprint, boosting their IoT portfolio and positioning them for growth in high-demand areas.

•	Qualcomm Partnership: Their collaboration with Qualcomm introduced versatile Edge AI functionality that enabled unique use cases like smart city solutions and enterprise IoT applications, proving the adaptability of Lantronix’s platform.

•	Profitability Potential: Lantronix was already on the cusp of profitability, operating as a strong IoT player prior to these new changes.

•	P/S Ratio: Despite their potential, Lantronix remains undervalued with a P/S ratio of 0.88, compared to the industry average of 2.2–2.5. At industry-average valuations, the stock would be worth over $10 per share, more than 2x its current price.

Now, the recent presentations at CES and the Needham Growth Conference have provided new insights that take this story to another level.

New Things We Learned This Month

•	Qualcomm Partnership Clarified: Qualcomm confirmed that Lantronix is their primary Western partner for Edge AI. Qualcomm will handle massive contracts over $50M while funneling smaller opportunities (up to $40M or 100k units) directly to Lantronix. One of these opportunities includes a $10–20M contract with John Deere, which could account for 10–15% of LTRX’s current annual revenue.

•	NetComm Brings Major Customers: The acquisition not only added 5G but also introduced Vodafone and Coca-Cola as major clients. Coca-Cola plans to use Lantronix tech to monitor, analyze, and automate restocking for their freestyle drink machines, opening the door to further expansion.

•	New Product Launch: Lantronix has developed a smart power management module for AI data centers, an industry seeing rapid growth. This product is expected to be a key revenue driver as AI infrastructure continues to expand.

•	Smart City Innovation: They’re working on a smart camera system for banks, designed to detect and prevent robbery threats before they happen.

•	Low-Code/No-Code Solution: Their gunshot detection system demonstrated that they announced in early January shows off the flexibility of their low-code platform, allowing developers to customize Edge AI products for entirely new use cases outside of Lantronix’s normal verticals.

What’s Next: February Earnings

With all this in mind, February earnings could be a pivotal moment for Lantronix. I expect strong forward guidance, reflecting the Qualcomm pipeline, Coca-Cola and Vodafone customer contributions, and the rollout of new products. If they include revenue from the delayed federal contract in this report, we could see an even bigger bump in outlook.","['QCOM', 'QCOM', 'QCOM', 'QCOM', 'QCOM', 'QCOM']",5,1,1,2025-01-27 01:40:44+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/WallStreetbetsELITE/comments/1iawi6o/lantronix_ltrx_working_with_cocacola_and_other/,0.9907

WallStreetbetsELITE,DD: Sam Altman Admits to Being an NPC – Puts on All USA AI Tech Stocks,"*TL;DR: Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, recently admitted to falling into the ""NPC trap,"" implying he’s been following mainstream narratives without critical thinking. If the guy leading the AI revolution has been on autopilot, it’s time to short the entire USA AI tech sector. Puts on NVDA, MSFT, GOOGL, BBAI, and anything AI-related. This is the next big play.*

# The NPC Revelation

In a recent public statement, Sam Altman admitted to falling into the ""NPC trap,"" referring to himself as someone who followed mainstream narratives without critically evaluating them. Specifically, he said:  
*""I wish I had done more of my own thinking and definitely fell in the NPC trap.""* [Source](https://x.com/sama/status/1882234406662000833)

For those who don’t know, an NPC (non-player character) is a term from gaming culture used to describe characters controlled by the game, not the player. In internet slang, it’s often used to describe people who lack independent thought or agency.

If the CEO of OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT and the Stargate AI project, is admitting he’s been an NPC, what does that say about the entire AI sector?

# Why This Matters

1. **Leadership Matters**: If the guy leading the AI revolution has been on autopilot, how much of OpenAI’s growth strategy is actually well-thought-out? Altman’s admission suggests he’s been following trends rather than innovating. This raises serious questions about the sustainability of OpenAI’s projects, including the $500 billion Stargate AI infrastructure initiative.
2. **AI Bubble**: The AI sector has been riding a massive hype wave, with companies like NVIDIA, Microsoft, and Google seeing their valuations skyrocket. But if the visionary behind the movement is admitting he hasn’t been thinking critically, it’s a red flag for the entire industry.
3. **Market Overreliance on AI**: The market has priced in exponential growth for AI, but if the leadership at OpenAI is flawed, the entire sector could be overvalued. This is a classic case of ""sell the news.""

# The Play: Puts on USA AI Tech Stocks

If Altman has been an NPC, then the entire AI sector is built on shaky foundations. Here’s why you should consider puts on AI-related stocks:

1. **OpenAI’s Overextension**: The Stargate project is a $500 billion gamble. If Altman hasn’t been thinking critically, this project could be a money pit. Short MSFT (Microsoft), which is heavily invested in OpenAI.
2. **NVIDIA (NVDA)**: The AI chip king has seen its stock soar, but if the AI bubble bursts, NVDA will be hit hard. Puts on NVDA are a no-brainer.
3. **Google (GOOGL)**: Google’s AI efforts are already struggling to keep up with OpenAI. If OpenAI falters, Google’s AI investments will look even worse.
4. [**BigBear.ai**](http://BigBear.ai) **(BBAI)**: This smaller AI player is already on shaky ground, with questionable fundamentals and overhyped contracts. If the AI sector takes a hit, BBAI will crater. Puts on BBAI are a high-risk, high-reward play.
5. **AI ETFs**: If you want broader exposure, consider puts on AI-focused ETFs like BOTZ or AIQ.

# Risks to the Play

1. **AI Hype is Strong**: The market loves AI, and even bad news might not be enough to kill the hype.
2. **Altman’s Recovery**: If Altman pivots and starts thinking critically again, the sector could recover.
3. **Government Backing**: The US government is heavily invested in AI leadership, which could prop up the sector even if fundamentals weaken.

# Conclusion

Sam Altman’s NPC admission is a huge red flag for the AI sector. If the guy leading the charge has been on autopilot, it’s time to bet against the entire industry. Puts on NVDA, MSFT, GOOGL, BBAI, and AI ETFs are the way to go.

I'm writing this quickly while I'm waiting for my unemployment check, so do your own diligence.


Reasons:
* 8 to 1 reverse split recently to fund gen3 launches which are starting in Feb, this created a low float
* Margins on data collections are 70-80%
* Gen3 models have are dual threat high res and SWIR. This means better fidelity with options in nighttime, obvious tactical advantage 
* Gen3 testing laser comms which means faster data to customer. Less reliance on ground stations.
* Driftable LEO orbit + better data transfers means faster revisits at different times of day means more unique customer images means more money at crazy margins
* Gen 3 data > Gen 2 data so any current customer who wants actual useful data needs to update/pay more. Easy upsell 
* PLTR invested in these dudes early on. There's a reason why they did. The raster images can feed pretty easily into foundry it seems

Prior to the reverse split this stock stayed around $4-$10 and this was before the AI explosion, influx of space force funding, PLTR entering the stratosphere and demonstrating the benefit of geoint within foundry and allied nations needing their own Intel feed. Everything macro seems to be in BKSY's favor and their birds seemed to be in the best location orbit wise to make the most out of their rapid revisits, so this stock is extremely underpriced IMO.

WallStreetbetsELITE,YOLO DD: Ubisoft is the Place to Put your Grandpa's Savings??,"Listen up, my fellow degenerates. I’ve got a stonk that’s ready to send us to Valhalla (or Lambo Land, whichever comes first).

# Why Ubisoft is a Rocket 🚀

1.      **Assassin’s Creed Shadows= CASH MONEY** Bro, the new *Assassin’s Creed Shadow*s is going to be FIRE (OUT FEBRUARY 2025). None of that bloated RPG nonsense anymore; this one goes back to the OG stealthy-stabby roots. Gamers are eating it up like chicken tenders on sale. If it sells like gangbusters (which it will), it’s gonna make the suits absolutely lose their minds and pile into this thing. More sales = more tendies for us. Easy math

2.      **Acquisition Rumors? SAY LESS** Tencent already has their fat fingers in Ubisoft’s pie, and word on the street is they’re hungry for more. The Guillemot fam (the French dudes running the show) are basically like, “Yeah, we might sell this thing for the right price.” A takeover = instant 🚀🚀🚀. Imagine Microsoft or Tencent buying Ubisoft to stack their gaming portfolio. BOOM. Strong together., easy 50% upside

3.      **Short Interest = SQUEEZE CITY �**�🔥 Let’s talk about the bears. They’re shorting Ubisoft HARD because they think the company can’t fix its act after some flops and all the days... stock has been so weak. This is why I THINK it's been so WEAK AF

# Ubisoft = Sitting on a Literal Gold Mine of IP worth >100% of market cap💎

Here’s the deal, Ubisoft isn’t just a game publisher. It’s basically a vault stuffed with treasure chests of gaming IP, and Wall Street is sleeping on it harder than your ex on a lazy Sunday. Let’s break it down:

# 1. Royalty Game Strong AF 💰

Old games, dead? LOL, nah. Gamers LOVE nostalgia, and Ubisoft is cashing in on it. You think people aren’t still buying *Assassin’s Creed Brotherhood*, *Far Cry 3*, or *Splinter Cell*? These games are forever bangers. They keep selling ‘em on every platform (*Steam, Xbox, PSN, Switch, even mobile now*), and it’s basically free money at this point.

# 2. IP = Priceless

·         **Assassin’s Creed:** The franchise has sold 200+ million copies and is still one of the biggest names in gaming. You KNOW they’re gonna milk this for the next 20 years.

·         **Far Cry:** Literally defines open-world FPS games. It’s a fan favorite, and new titles or remasters always print cash.

·         **Rainbow Six Siege:** Six years in, and this thing is still a competitive multiplayer juggernaut. Microtransactions and esports keep this thing alive FOREVER.

·         **Splinter Cell:** Haven’t even released a new one in years, and

WallStreetbetsELITE,RK Tweet - Is this what it means?,"January 2nd, 2000, was a **Sunday**, so the U.S. stock markets (and most global markets) were closed. However, it marked a significant moment in market history because it was right in the midst of the **Dot-Com Bubble**, a period of extreme speculation in technology and internet-related stocks.

Here’s some relevant context surrounding that date:

# 1. Dot-Com Bubble Peak

* The **Nasdaq Composite** was trading near its all-time high during this period, fuelled by massive enthusiasm for tech and internet stocks.
* On January 3rd, 2000 (the next trading day), the Nasdaq opened at 4,041 and rose sharply to hit new records over the following weeks before ultimately beginning its sharp decline in March 2000.
* Many overvalued tech stocks were trading at unsustainable valuations, with little to no earnings, purely based on speculation.

# 2. Y2K Fears Receding

* January 2nd, 2000, came right after the much-hyped **Y2K (Year 2000)** event, where there were widespread concerns that computer systems worldwide might fail due to the ""millennium bug.""
* As markets reopened on January 3rd, investors realised that Y2K fears had been largely overblown, contributing to a bullish sentiment in the short term.

# 3. Broader Market Context

* The broader market (S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average) was also at high levels, but there was a growing divergence between the tech-heavy Nasdaq and traditional industrial and value stocks.
* This was a period of rapid capital inflows into speculative tech stocks, while more traditional sectors like energy and consumer goods began to lag.

# Significance in Retrospect

While nothing specific happened on January 2nd, 2000, that date is significant as part of the larger historical moment leading into the peak of the Dot-Com Bubble. The **burst of this bubble in 2000–2001** led to significant declines in stock markets, wiping out trillions in market value and serving as a cautionary tale of speculative excess.

# How does this Compare to current market conditions:

There are **similarities** between the market conditions during the Dot-Com Bubble and some aspects of the current market environment. However, there are also notable differences, given changes in technology, monetary policy, and market participants. Here's a comparison:

# 1. Speculative Mania and Overvalued Assets

# Dot-Com Bubble (2000):

* The late 1990s saw a surge in speculative investment in tech companies, particularly internet-related stocks. Many of these companies had no earnings and minimal revenues but traded at sky-high valuations based on ""growth potential.""
* Investors were driven by fear of missing out (FOMO) on the internet revolution, leading to valuations that were unsustainable.

# Current Market:

* In recent years, we’ve seen a similar speculative frenzy, particularly in sectors like **technology**, **cryptocurrencies**, **SPACs** (special purpose acquisition companies), and **""meme stocks""** like GameStop (GME) and AMC.
* Companies with minimal earnings have still attracted significant investment based on growth narratives (e.g., AI, EVs, and blockchain technologies).
* The difference now is the **role of retail investors**, amplified by platforms like Robinhood and social media, which weren’t factors in 2000.

**Similarity**: Both periods experienced speculative bubbles fuelled by hype and FOMO, with capital flowing disproportionately into unproven assets or companies.

# 2. Monetary Policy and Interest Rates

# Dot-Com Bubble:

* The late 1990s were marked by **low interest rates** and a strong economy, encouraging borrowing and risk-taking.
* However, the Federal Reserve started raising interest rates in 1999 to cool down the economy, tightening monetary policy. This contributed to the eventual market crash as higher rates reduced the attractiveness of speculative investments.

# Current Market:

* Over the last decade, **ultra-low interest rates** and **quantitative easing (QE)** by central banks have driven asset prices to record highs. Cheap money encouraged investors to take on risk.
* Recently, the **Federal Reserve** and other central banks have been raising interest rates aggressively to combat inflation, tightening liquidity and increasing the cost of leverage.
* The tech-heavy Nasdaq has been hit particularly hard as higher rates reduce the present value of future cash flows, which many high-growth companies rely on for valuation.

**Similarity**: Both periods saw speculative bubbles inflated during low-rate environments, with subsequent rate hikes contributing to market corrections.

# 3. Retail Investor Participation

# Dot-Com Bubble:

* Retail investors were highly active in the late 1990s, often chasing the hottest internet stocks. Many lacked a fundamental understanding of the companies they were investing in but were drawn in by promises of massive future growth.
* Online trading platforms like E\*TRADE made stock market access easier but were nowhere near as widespread as modern tools.

# Current Market:

* Retail investors play an even larger role today, thanks to **commission-free trading platforms** like Robinhood and the rise of social media communities (e.g., Reddit’s [r/WallStreetBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/WallStreetBets/)).
* Meme stock rallies (e.g., GME, AMC) have shown how retail investors can band together to create massive price surges, often targeting hedge funds with short positions.
* Retail trading is now amplified by access to options markets, which add significant leverage and volatility.

**Similarity**: Retail investor enthusiasm and speculative behaviour are strong in both periods, but today's retail investors are more organised and influential.

# 4. Technology Leadership

# Dot-Com Bubble:

* The internet was a transformative technology, but many companies were in the early stages of development. This made it difficult to differentiate between legitimate opportunities (e.g., Amazon) and companies with no viable business model (e.g., Pets.com).

# Current Market:

* Technologies like **artificial intelligence (AI)**, **electric vehicles (EVs)**, and **blockchain** are seen as transformative, just as the internet was in 2000.
* While some companies are well-established and profitable (e.g., Tesla, Nvidia), others in the space have unclear paths to sustainable profitability, making the speculative environment similar to 2000.

**Similarity**: Both periods were/are defined by the hype around revolutionary technologies that attracted speculative capital.

# 5. Valuations and Corrections

# Dot-Com Bubble:

* The Nasdaq Composite rose more than 400% between 1995 and its peak in March 2000, with price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios of tech companies reaching unprecedented levels.
* The crash that followed wiped out trillions in market value, with the Nasdaq falling nearly 78% from its peak by 2002.

# Current Market:

* Similar to the late 1990s, valuations in some sectors (e.g., AI stocks) have reached very high levels. While there hasn’t been a full-scale crash, 2022–2023 saw significant corrections in tech stocks due to rate hikes.
* The Nasdaq fell over 30% in 2022, marking its worst year since the Dot-Com Bubble burst, but it has partially rebounded in 2023-2024.

**Similarity**: Both periods have seen bubbles in tech-heavy sectors, with subsequent corrections tied to rising interest rates.

# Key Differences

1. **Liquidity and Central Bank Influence**:
   * The current market has been far more influenced by central bank policies (e.g., QE, tightening). Liquidity injections played a key role in driving the 2020-2021 bull market, unlike in 2000.
2. **Globalisation and Connectivity**:
   * Today's markets are far more interconnected, with retail and institutional investors trading globally. This increases market complexity and volatility.
3. **Strength of Underlying Companies**:
   * While some speculative companies today are overvalued, many established tech giants (e.g., Apple, Microsoft) are fundamentally strong and profitable, unlike many dot-com-era companies.

# Final Thoughts

While there are strong parallels between the Dot-Com Bubble and current market conditions—particularly in speculative enthusiasm, high valuations, and the impact of rate hikes—the modern market also reflects key structural differences, such as the role of central banks and the influence of retail investors. Whether we’re in a bubble similar to 2000 or not, the lessons from that period about sustainable valuations and the risks of speculation remain highly relevant.

# Specifically, how does this compare to Meme Stocks like GME & AMC:

GameStop (GME) is an interesting case when comparing it to the Dot-Com Bubble and current market dynamics. While not a perfect parallel, GME embodies elements of speculation, retail-driven activity, and market distortions that are reminiscent of 2000. Let’s break it down:

# 1. Speculation and Hype

# Dot-Com Bubble (2000):

* During the late 1990s, investors poured money into internet companies based purely on hype. Many companies had little to no earnings or a viable business model but traded at astronomical valuations.
* The bubble was driven by speculative enthusiasm for new, revolutionary technologies, even though many of the companies were unprofitable.

# GME Today:

* GameStop’s meteoric rise in 2021 wasn’t driven by traditional fundamentals like earnings or revenue growth. Instead, it became a **symbol of retail investor activism**, with traders on forums like Reddit’s [r/WallStreetBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/WallStreetBets/) targeting hedge funds with short positions.
* The hype around GME wasn’t about a new technology or disruptive innovation but rather about the narrative of **short squeezes**, **market manipulation**, and **""sticking it to Wall Street.""**
* Like the Dot-Com Bubble, much of the speculative activity around GME was driven by emotion and narrative rather than intrinsic value.

**Key Similarity**: Both GME and many dot-com companies became overvalued because of speculative enthusiasm rather than fundamentals.

# 2. Retail Investor Participation

# Dot-Com Bubble:

* Retail investors flooded the market in the late 1990s, often chasing hot internet stocks without understanding the underlying businesses.
* Many investors suffered huge losses when the bubble burst because they didn’t fully grasp the risks involved.

# GME Today:

* GME is **a retail investor phenomenon**, with a community-driven movement to buy and hold shares, often at any price, regardless of fundamentals.
* Social media has amplified retail participation, allowing for coordinated action that wasn’t possible in 2000.
* Unlike the Dot-Com Bubble, the GME movement is partly ideological, with retail investors opposing perceived Wall Street manipulation.

**Key Similarity**: Both periods saw retail investors taking outsized risks in speculative assets. The main difference is that GME investors often acted with deliberate defiance of traditional market norms.

# 3. Short Interest and Market Dynamics

# Dot-Com Bubble:

* During the bubble, short-selling wasn’t as significant a focus. Investors were overwhelmingly long on speculative internet stocks, believing the sky was the limit.
* While some hedge funds profited by shorting overvalued dot-com companies, they didn’t face the same level of retail scrutiny.

# GME Today:

* GME’s rise was directly tied to **short interest**, with hedge funds heavily shorting the stock, betting on its decline. At one point, short interest exceeded 100% of available shares, creating conditions for a **short squeeze**.
* Retail investors capitalised on this, forcing hedge funds to cover their positions, which led to GME’s rapid price spikes in early 2021.
* This dynamic, where short positions and retail coordination interact, didn’t exist in the same way during the Dot-Com Bubble.

**Key Difference**: GME’s price movements are heavily influenced by short interest and retail-driven short squeezes, which weren’t a significant factor in the Dot-Com era.

# 4. Fundamentals vs. Narrative

# Dot-Com Bubble:

* Many dot-com companies had no earnings or sustainable business models, but investors justified high valuations based on the **potential of the internet revolution**.
* The narrative of the ""new economy"" drove valuations, even though most companies ultimately failed.

# GME Today:

* GME’s business, centred on physical video game retail, has faced challenges from digital distribution and declining brick-and-mortar retail.
* While there have been efforts to pivot the company toward e-commerce (e.g., under Ryan Cohen’s leadership), the stock’s valuation remains largely detached from its actual financial performance.
* Instead of being tied to a revolutionary technology like the internet, GME’s valuation is tied to **community-driven narratives** about fighting Wall Street and exploiting market inefficiencies.

**Key Similarity**: Both GME and many dot-com stocks achieved high valuations detached from their fundamentals, driven instead by powerful narratives.

# 5. Volatility and Market Manipulation

# Dot-Com Bubble:

* Internet stocks in the late 1990s were extremely volatile, with sharp rallies and sell-offs. However, the volatility was largely driven by a lack of understanding of how to value these companies.
* Accusations of market manipulation were less prominent, though insider trading and pump-and-dump schemes were not uncommon.

# GME Today:

* GME has experienced **extreme volatility**, with its stock price swinging wildly due to short squeezes, gamma squeezes (from options activity), and community-driven buying sprees.
* Accusations of **market manipulation** are more central to GME’s story, with retail investors alleging unfair practices by hedge funds, market makers, and clearinghouses during events like the Robinhood trading restrictions in January 2021.

**Key Difference**: GME’s volatility is more tied to specific market mechanics (e.g., short interest, options activity) and allegations of manipulation, while the Dot-Com Bubble’s volatility was driven by speculative uncertainty.

# 6. Role of Central Banks and Macroeconomics

# Dot-Com Bubble:

* The bubble formed during a period of low interest rates but burst after the Federal Reserve began raising rates in 1999–2000.
* The crash exposed the fragility of speculative investments when liquidity tightened.

# GME Today:

* GME rose during a period of **ultra-low interest rates** and excessive liquidity following the COVID-19 pandemic. Stimulus cheques, low borrowing costs, and a surge in retail trading created fertile ground for speculative activity.
* As the Federal Reserve began raising rates in 2022, speculative stocks like GME faced significant headwinds, with trading volumes declining and valuations compressing.
* GME’s long-term sustainability as a speculative asset may depend on macroeconomic factors, particularly liquidity and retail participation.

**Key Similarity**: Both GME and the Dot-Com Bubble were shaped by monetary conditions, with rate hikes acting as a catalyst for reducing speculation.

# Final Thoughts

While GME’s rise has unique elements—such as retail investor coordination and short squeezes—it shares many similarities with the Dot-Com Bubble. Both periods were defined by speculative excess, detachment from fundamentals, and powerful narratives driving investment decisions.

However, the main **difference** is that GME’s story is as much about market mechanics and activism as it is about speculation. The retail-driven movement to challenge institutional dominance is a modern phenomenon that didn’t exist in the same way during the Dot-Com era.

A long read so apologies, but the general consensus is that our current markets are similar to that of the 2000's when the dot-com bubble happened. Is March lining up to be when meme stocks will rally?

WallStreetbetsELITE,"A closer look at Archer Aviation, Joby and the eVTOL market","It’s fascinating to watch the electric vehicle and electric air taxi markets react to President Trump’s new administration, especially considering the massive potential these sectors hold. However, it’s clear that Trump’s first executive orders—specifically targeting the EV sector—have shaken investor confidence. The rollback of emissions regulations and the cancellation of the electric vehicle mandate seem like a serious blow to the momentum that had been building in the EV space. This isn’t just about whether EVs are the future, it's about whether the government will create the right environment to make them a viable mainstream option in the long run. Trump’s decision to dismantle policies that would push automakers toward EVs is a massive gamble for the future of clean energy transportation.

It’s no surprise to see Tesla’s stock fall in reaction to this news. Tesla, which has been the golden child of the Electric Vehicle Movement, is highly dependent on the regulatory environment. If those regulations are relaxed or reversed, it could mean more competition from traditional automakers who are less inclined to invest in EVs without the regulatory pressure. 

Then, there’s the electric air taxi sector, which feels like an entirely different thing. Stocks like Archer Aviation and Joby Aviation are soaring, even though they’re still years away from profitability. But there’s a certain excitement around the idea of electric aircraft taking to the skies, cutting down on traffic and revolutionizing short-distance travel. The Trump administration’s stance on deregulation could actually play in their favor, potentially speeding up approval for commercial air taxis. 

With all the current chaos, the market is on edge because of Trump’s executive orders, and rightfully so. But it’s crucial to remember that the future of the EV and electric air taxi industries is still up for grabs, and while short-term risks are high, the long-term potential for these sectors remains strong.","['TSLA', 'TSLA']",1,0,0,2025-01-22 16:12:17+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/WallStreetbetsELITE/comments/1i7ep7m/a_closer_look_at_archer_aviation_joby_and_the/,0.9796

WallStreetbetsELITE,7 stocks are controlling the SPX... ,"The ""Magnificent Seven"" (Mag 7) refers to seven dominant tech companies that have significantly influenced the S&P 500 (SPY) due to their substantial market capitalizations and heavy weightings in the index. These companies are:

1. Apple (AAPL)
2. Microsoft (MSFT)
3. Amazon (AMZN)
4. Alphabet (GOOGL/GOOG)
5. NVIDIA (NVDA)
6. Tesla (TSLA)
7. Meta Platforms (META)



How They Influence SPY:

Weighting Impact: The SPY is a market-cap-weighted index, meaning the largest companies have the most influence on its movement. The Mag 7 stocks collectively account for a significant percentage of the SPY’s total market cap (over 25% in 2024). Therefore, their performance often dictates the direction of the index.

Tech-Driven Movements: The Mag 7 stocks belong to sectors like technology and consumer discretionary, which tend to react strongly to macroeconomic conditions, including interest rates, inflation, and innovation trends. Their performance creates volatility and directionality in SPY.

Earnings Impact: When these companies report earnings, they often set the tone for the broader market, as their results can influence sentiment across sectors.


Key Considerations for SPY Control:

1. Sector Concentration Risk: The dominance of these stocks creates sector concentration risk. A sell-off in one or more of these names can disproportionately impact SPY.


2. Interest Rates Sensitivity: Growth-oriented companies like those in the Mag 7 are highly sensitive to changes in interest rates, as higher rates can compress valuations.


3. Diversification Challenge: Investors in SPY are indirectly concentrated in these stocks, even though the ETF holds 500 companies.


4. Volatility Opportunities: For traders like you, understanding the outsized influence of the Mag 7 on SPY can provide opportunities for swing trades or options plays, especially around earnings seasons or macroeconomic events like Fed announcements.","['AAPL', 'MSFT', 'AMZN', 'NVDA', 'TSLA', 'META', 'META']",49,25,11,2025-01-19 23:43:54+00:00,https://i.redd.it/7hqw6cere1ee1.png,0.9884

So you know how 5G was going to be a complete game changer, promising to be like a WiFi away-from-home? Whatever happened with that? Fuck all, that's what happened. Why? Well, that's a bit complicated, but let me just break it down in very basic terms:

1. The reason 5G was expected to be such a big upgrade was, in part, due to the expansion of the frequency range into what's known as mmWave. 
2. At these mmWave frequencies, signals can contain *a lot* more data, providing much higher speeds. 
3. However, mmWave signals have an intrinsically shittier range than lower frequencies. To counter this, you need to steer the signals towards the receivers/transceivers in order for the signals to arrive at the target (imagine a lantern vs. a flashlight). This steering is called beamforming.
4. You can do this in two ways: analog or digital. The digital solution is objectively much better, no one will question that, but there has been a lot of concerns about the cost/power efficiency and the complexity of this tech. So, when the 5G rollout was being planned, all the major players went for the easy, analog solution. The only problem with ABF is that it fucking sucks, and this is one of the reasons the 5G hype just kinda died out. 
5. The founders of BeammWave realized this would happen long before it actually did, so they started to work on a digital solution viable for mass volume production. 
6. Now, 10 years later, they have actually fucking done it, and the implications are potentially *massive*. 
7. BeammWave is currently selling an advanced developing platform (ADP1) which allows customers to evaluate their technology and use it to build their own prototypes incorporating BeammWaves technology for future commercial products. 

  
**BeammWave's product:**

* A radio-frequency integrated circuit (RFIC) coupled with software, optimized for high-volume production. 
* It's both better and cheaper than today's alternatives.
* The goal is to replace the currently used (shitty) antennas/RFICs in not only smartphones, but in radars/satellites/drones/IoTs/automotives/FWAs etc. 
* This means that BeammWave is not dependent on a single market, and will never develop an end-consumer-product. Instead, their technology will be a small but vital part in *a lot* of different devices. 

**BeammWave's market:**

* The market for their technology is just massive. For example, the estimated price is **$**1-2 per RFIC and a typical smartphone would carry 6-10 chips. MobileExperts has projected that some 270 million units will be mmWave enabled by 2026, meaning that the TAM would be in the **$**2.2-4.4bn range.

* Handsets are just *one* of BeammWave’s markets, so it actually becomes quite ridiculous when you start to crunch the numbers. We’re talking tens of billions of dollars if they manage to get even, let’s say, 15% of their TAM, and that is not considering how the mmWave market is expected to have a CAGR of 15-40% until 2030. 
* Also worth noting is that they're the only ones who have managed to do this. As for now they don't really have any competitors, and they have laid down a minefield of patents aiming to own the entire field of distributed digital beamforming. 

**BeammWave's financials:**

* They just completed a warrants issue, and coupled with grants and sales of their ADP1 platform in Q4 they should have about 50M SEK in cash at hand right now, with the annual burn rate of 2023 being around 29M SEK. 
* Thus, they should be liquid enough to get through >1 full year without any additional revenue. 
* However, they have made clear that they expect several more ADP1 customers short-term, will probably receive additional government grants and their stated plan is to have revenue-generating products hitting the market in 2025-2026. 
* So far, they have never done any unwarranted hype-building or promised things they couldn't keep, instead focusing on building long-term credibility, so I have no clear reason to doubt their words on this.

**Current customers/partners:**

BeammWave has stated that they are having discussions with pretty much every major player in the industry, having signed NDAs with all market leaders (think Samsung, Qualcomm etc.). However, they have already made a number of partners/customers public:

* **Molex:** A leading electronics manufacturer, owned by Koch Industries. Supplier to a shitload of companies, including Apple. They purchased BeammWave's ADP1 developing platform about a year ago, and is actively building prototypes for commercialization. According to BeammWave's CEO, everything is going ""very well"", and any news of commercial products would be a *major* catalyst for BeammWave's share price. The main focus of the project is to incorporate BeammWave's tech into new FPGA systems, which is currently a >**$**12bn market with an expected CAGR of 16.4% until 2029. 
* **Alpha Networks:** A Taiwanese, global leader in the networking industry (>18bn TWD market cap, >4000 employees). The project with BeammWave was announced last fall, with the objective to study the creation of high-performance CPEs intended for FWA systems, also for complicated radio environments and extreme weather conditions. The global 5G FWA market size was valued at >**$**29bn in 2023 and is projected to reach >**$**150bn by 2028, at a CAGR of almost 40%. 
* **Anonymous Asian customer:** Last year BeammWave announced that an anonymous global market leader (>**$**10bn turnover, >70 000 employees) had purchased their ADP1 platform. It is speculated that this customer is probably muRata, the Japanese electronic manufacturing giant (supplier to *a lot* of companies, including Qualcomm and Apple). The goal of this purchase is not specified, more than that they are evaluating BeammWave's technology. 
* **Saab:** A Swedish defense company (>**$**10bn market cap, >21 000 employees) developing and manufacturing weapons systems, jet fighters, drones, radars etc. They are currently working with BeammWave to develop military products using commercial hardware (most likely focusing on drones). 
* **Additional companies:** Apart from these, BeammWave is working on a number of government-funded projects together with a bunch of different companies (including **Ericsson**).
* **World class foundry:** BeammWave has been given access to one of the biggest foundries in the world (in Germany) to produce their prototype chips (and getting assistance with material/production). This is practically unheard of for a company of this size.

**BeammWave's people:**

The company is founded—and still run by—engineers. There is not one professional finance-bro-hustler in sight, only these old grandpas (literally) with more than a century of combined experience working at the biggest telecom companies in the world. For example:

* **CEO:** Stefan Svedberg, an electrical engineer who at Ericsson had a driving role in the development and global success of Bluetooth. Was also responsible for several Ericsson M&As.
* **VP of Business and Sales:** Robert Cadman, who was in part responsible for bringing the Bluetooth technology to the markets. 
* **Chief Systems Architect:** Bengt Lindoff, one of the world’s most prolific inventors with +2000 patents in his name, who most recently had a top position at Huawei. 
* **Chairman of the board:** Fredrik Rosenqvist, a civil engineer and the ex-CEO of Saab Ventures, who amongst other things facilitated the sale of C3 to Apple

I could go on, but you get the drill. Together, they not only carry an enormous respect within the industry—with far-reaching connections to the people at the very top of the big companies—but also an incredible know-how in just what it takes to successfully launch a new technology. Furthermore, the inside ownership is substantial, with the management having taken part in every share issue and have frequently bought additional shares ATM. 

**Risks:**

I can talk about the company for as long as I want, but in the end it's a gamble, and there's obviously a few risks.

* **Patent disputes:** It's a cut-throat industry where patent disputes are quite common. If the big players just decide to bully BeammWave and steal their lunch money (aka patents), they're probably in big trouble. However, considering the NDAs signees and the ADP1 sales, as well as the experienced company management, I would say they have reduced the risk of that happening as much as they possibly can. But again, if it happens I'm probably cooked. 
* **Their technology turns out to suck:** Well, then I'm definitely cooked. Since I'm not an expert in this field I put a lot of trust in the company management whom I believe are very down-to-earth and competent, with a documented history of success. Also, considering the amount (and quality) of customers/partners they have already attracted, I find it unlikely that the technology is shit. But who knows? Stranger things have happened. 

I'm not an RF engineer, nor have I yet figured out how to make the old crystal ball work. To lose these $15k would obviously hurt, but if it happens I can afford it. Don't invest in anything (especially not a start-up) with money you can't afford to lose. 

**The end:**  
This post got pretty long, despite me trying to keep it dense. For example, I haven't event touched on the prospects of an acquisition, which I personally believe is probably the most likely case (by Apple, Qualcomm or some other giant player).

Cheers!

DD","$Hive digital technologies: Primed for massive breakout this week 🚀🌙

 “you’re paying for the robust balance sheet (no debt) and getting the AI and btc mining business for free” 

key takeaways: 

\-Company relocating HQ to San Antonio, Tx and will begin reporting GAAP audited financials post March 2025: citing favorable crypto market opportunities and liquidity conditions in the U.S under Trump. High probability of building U.S power assets. 

\-current stock price: $2.9 

\-Fair Value: $7.5 

Important ratios:

 \-book value per share:$2.65 

\-P/B : 1.1

 \-P/S 2025: 1x 

\-Trading at CY 2026 EV/EBITDA: 1.5x 

\-post February 2025 earnings (trailing twelve month PE ratio) 5-6x due to btc appreciation on balance sheet quarter over quarter

\-15 EH/S by summer 2025, 17 J/TH 

\-they have the highest operational has rate uptime in the industry at 94% 

\-at the guided hashrate the company will be mining \~2-300 Btc a month, or 3600 a year with a full HODL strategy

* they currently have 2800 BTC on the balance sheet valued at .7 of the entire market cap of the company. Which means for every share you get .7 btc, and if you add net PPE, cash holdings, you end up with a company valued at a discount to its book value.

 \-they have the AI narrative, partnership with nvidia, they offer AI/HPC services, but insignificant amount of revenue and not spending a ton on capex for that 

\-by summer of 2025, company will be able to hodl up to 4000 btc from what they have mined, with a conservative 100k Btc price, that’s $400M, and they have near 0 debt…. 

\-after achieving 15 EH/S after summer, operations through the end of the year could yield them an additional 1800 btc, putting year end hodl at 5800, with the same btc price of $100k would put them at $580M, or 50% higher than todays market cap through organic mining. 

\-they are fully funded to 15 EH/S, so even with 20% dilution to cover expenses, the stock would still be trading at a 35% discount to their balance sheet. 

As far as valuation goes: 

Company projects 2025 EBITDA at $60M which is conservative, given a $100k Btc would generate $80-$90M, but setting that aside: 

Operating valuation: Company guided $60M EBITDA (CY2025) x 10 (conservative growth multiple) = $600M 

Holdings company Valuation: 

End of 2025 Btc holdings (4000 @ $100k) = $400M 

Add PPE of $100M 

All together: 

1.1B divided by 20% diluted shares outstanding by EOY 2025 158M shares = \~$7.5 per share, not including the AI/HPC business 

How to value the AI/HPC business? 

Roth MKM initiates (BUY $7.50 Price Target): 

“Initiate with Buy and $7.50 PT. We assign a \~15x multiple (20% discount) to HIVE's CY25 AEBITDA estimate of \~$60M, yielding a $7.50 price target and a Buy rating. Accelerated capital access could speed up HPC/AI growth, while clarity on AI Cloud vs. HPC colocation could boost investor confidence and multiples…. Diverse business model with the flexibility to move further into HPC/AI Cloud services market, which would drive revaluation. Today, HIVE generates \~90% of its revenue from self-mining BTC, but has been generating revenue from an emerging AI Cloud business since March 2023. Its AI Cloud business has reached an ARR of \~$10M as of September, but we anticipate HIVE to capitalize on the growing demand for AI services that should see AI ARR double to $20M by 1QCY25 and also targeting an ARR of $100M by year-end CY25, subject to capital availability, to which we take a more conservative approach. Were this to occur, HIVE’s business profile (and sales mix) would be much more balanced, with higher revenue visibility, and margins. This dynamic we believe would begin to support incremental reinvestment into HPC/AI, which if executed upon, could help re-value shares. Moreover, HIVE has \~80MW of identified data centers in Canada and Sweden for potential retrofitting that could later service HPC colocation or HPC/AI, which we believe could help further revalue shares. We believe access to scalable power assets with low-cost energy will become increasingly valuable. HIVE is not the largest digital infrastructure company by power, hash rate, or HPC/AI targets, but what it may lack in size, it makes up for from a history of operating both self-mining and AI Cloud models. Moreover, HIVE’s data centers span four countries with a projected CY25 power capacity of \~258MW. We believe the growing demand for scalable power assets has skewed towards North America but could soon be followed by Europe. Both are markets where we believe HIVE can capitalize on this AI demand by providing access to low-cost, “green” energy, with favorable temperatures and internet connectivity to support HPC/AI workloads. Management has been flexible in its business models, and near term we expect incremental GPU purchases to drive AI upside for HIVE through CY25. Beyond that, we believe the potential to retrofit existing data centers in Sweden and/or Canada for HPC/AI use cases could amount to further share appreciation and a revaluation of its power assets. We believe this could happen faster if HIVE takes an HPC colocation approach, where we view the economics as more favorable ($1.5M/revenue per MW with 60-70% profit margins and long-term contracts).” -ROTH MKM 

How to position? $3 strike call options, expiring Jan 2026, this will give additional leverage that is capital efficient on the position, will provide 2-3x returns at given price target $7.5 

Another catalyst: Small caps tend to get lost, and stock screens are a good way to find cheap deals. In February 2025, the company will report over a $1 EPS… that will put the trailing twelve month PE ratio 5-6x… this will show up on stock screens and even though most of the EPS will be due to the appreciation of assets on the balance sheet, this will give way for more investors to dig into the company and realize the undervaluation. Once the market cap starts heading higher, larger funds will be able to position, which should increase institutional ownership.

Macro-presidential Catalyst: Now that Trump has began his grift with the launch of $Trump, and the SBR being announced Tuesday, all btc related names will pump… this one in particular because of its high btc/share… the time to get in is now. they currently have 2800 BTC on the balance sheet valued at .7 of the entire market cap of the company. Which means for every share you get .7 btc, and if you add net PPE, cash holdings, you end up with a company valued at a discount to its book value.",['NVDA'],36,39,15,2025-01-18 22:40:53+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/WallStreetbetsELITE/comments/1i4jgiq/hive_digital_technologies_primed_for_massive/,0.9992
WallStreetbetsELITE,Starbucks DD ,"🚨🚨🚨 YO DEGENERATES, LISTEN UP! 🚨🚨🚨

Starbucks ($SBUX) is primed to pop harder than your uncle's pants at Thanksgiving dinner. LET'S GOOOOO!!! 🚀☕
Why I'm YOLO'ing on $SBUX:

👑 NEW BOSS = BIG MOVES 👑
Brian ""Big Brain"" Niccol is at the wheel, boys! He turned Chipotle into a money-printing burrito machine, and now he’s four months deep into Starbucks, flexing his turnaround wizardry. Guy's already trimming fat at corporate like he's on keto, making this lean, mean caffeine machine unstoppable.

💥 ""BACK TO STARBUCKS"" = PRINTING 💥
Niccol's master plan:

    Cozy couches, ceramic mugs, and bars loaded with sugar bombs.
    Baristas getting TRAINED UP. Mandatory 3-hour ""how to Starbucks again"" sessions.
    The Wicked promo drinks? Straight 🔥—they’ll pump those YOY comps.

💸 EARNINGS ARE GONNA SLAP 💸
Q1 earnings drop Jan 28 after hours, right before the Fed decides on rates. Analysts expect a weak $0.66 EPS—guess what? SBUX is about to smash that. Niccol’s cooking up a surprise, and it ain’t just lattes. Last time they leaked Q4 early—this time? Radio silence. They’re holding back a nuke. ☢️

🔥 JOB CUTS = BIG BRAIN ENERGY 🔥
Starbucks just announced layoffs in corporate support roles (aka deadweight). They're cutting costs, but keeping baristas happy. Wall Street loves this kind of corporate carnage. That’s bullish AF.

📈 MARKET IS READY TO RIP 📈
Trump’s inauguration week is coming, and you know the market’s gonna go berserk. With no other big catalysts, $SBUX is riding that pump wave straight to Valhalla.

💎 TL;DR 💎

    New CEO is a WALL STREET DARLING.
    Promotions and store revamps mean $$$.
    Analysts are underestimating them harder than my mom underestimated my paper hands.
    Earnings surprise coming = 🚀🚀🚀.
    Stock’s chilling at $95—easily a 20% ripper to $115 if Niccol delivers.

CALLS ONLY. SPICY JAN 31 WEEKLIES. DON’T @ ME. LET’S PRINT SOME GAINS, BOYS. 💰💰💰

WallStreetbetsELITE,"The bull case for quantum is heating up! The last week in Quantum has been a roller coaster. DD and deep dive Jan 8, 2025 - Jan 15, 2025","I got absolutely slaughtered on this board a week ago for [suggesting there would be a rebound for the quantum sector in the near term](https://old.reddit.com/r/WallStreetbetsELITE/comments/1hxtsex/jensen_is_wrong_massive_rebound_for_quantum/).

I took the bearish sentiment in stride and tried to understand both sides of this discussion. I have done a considerable amount of research, and new information is coming out every day. It's hard to keep it all straight, but here's my DD and why I think the bull case for quantum is intact and gaining traction.

# Thesis

Quantum advancements are **not limited to quantum mainframe computers in data centers**. They can and will come in many forms, in the near term. There are many solid companies working on these complex challenges.  **Governments and enterprise will continue to pour money into quantum as a worldwide race has picked up steam**.  U.S. is currently far behind China, and there is bi-partisan support for increased spending \[[1](https://thequantuminsider.com/2024/12/04/senators-quantum-leaders-back-2-7-billion-national-quantum-initiative-reauthorization-act/)\].

It is estimated that Quantum as a market will be worth between $1T-$2T by 2035. I personally think this is a conservative estimate - i'll get into why below.

https://preview.redd.it/iba68bwlglde1.png?width=2374&format=png&auto=webp&s=32b44b2153db51a41305384450b6002b3b5bd6ce

• **Diverse Hardware Innovations**: Quantum advancements include sensors, quantum communication devices, and portable quantum processors, not just mainframe computers.

• **Domain-Specific Applications**: Quantum breakthroughs in cryptography, optimization, and material science are redefining industries without relying on large-scale mainframes.

• **Hybrid Systems**: Integration of quantum and classical computing enables scalable solutions, allowing quantum technologies to exist in versatile, decentralized forms.

# The market overreacted to Jensen Huang and Zuckerberg 's comments.

Jensen Huang, NVDA Jan 8 2025

>Someday we'll have very useful quantum computers. We're probably five or six orders of magnitudes away, 15 years for useful quantum computers and that would be on the early side. 30 years is probably on the late side. If you picked 20 years a whole bunch of us would believe it.

Alan Baratz, CEO D-Wave \[QBTS\] Jan 9, 2025

>""There are different approaches to quantum: annealing and gate are the two primary approaches. And while his \[Huang’s\] comments may not be totally off base for gate model quantum computers, they are 100% off base for annealing quantum computers. When it comes to D-Wave annealing quantum computing, he is dead wrong. We are not 30 years out, we're not 20 years out, we're not 15 years out. We are today. We are supporting businesses today with quantum compute to solve their hard problems,""

Mark Zuckerberg, Meta Jan 13, 2025

>“I’m not really an expert on quantum computing, but my understanding is that’s still quite a ways off from being a very useful paradigm,” he said during an appearance on Joe Rogan’s podcast published Friday, adding that many people think the technology is likely a “decade plus out.” -

Jensen seemed to miscalculate with a singular tunnel vision view of only quantum computers at scale in data centers replacing GPU's; he did not seem to realize or acknowledge the multi-modal, multi-domain, rapid acceleration of the smaller advances in the industry.

Zuckerberg - literally said he ""doesn't know much about quantum"" and then speculated. I believe it was a ""caught with pants down"" moment.

# Multiple Domains for advancements [computing, sensing]

The potential and applications for quantum will rapidly accelerate in the next 5 years, including the following domains:

https://preview.redd.it/12dyye7oglde1.png?width=2144&format=png&auto=webp&s=e5b2df557981682ca670d870b32729374b8a4e6d

Quantum is not limited to hardware. There are advances and use-cases across many domains and these will rapidly accelerate as hardware, software, applications, and services progress.

WallStreetbetsELITE,NurExone Biologic Secures Master Cell Bank,"https://preview.redd.it/ml6d65kw8tce1.jpg?width=1400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0887247f39d0281dba7e8a7c6f320f126f3d6dc1

TORONTO and HAIFA, Israel, Jan. 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NurExone Biologic Inc. (TSXV: NRX), (OTCQB: NRXBF), (Germany: J90) (""**NurExone**"" or the ""**Company**""), a developer of exosome-based therapies for regenerative medicine, is pleased to announce that it has acquired a master cell bank from a U.S. manufacturer for an undisclosed amount (the “**Acquisition**”). The Acquisition marks a major step in ensuring a stable and scalable supply chain for production of exosome-based therapies for clinical needs and eventual patient treatment.

The master cell bank provides a well-characterized, Good Manufacturing Practices (“**GMP**”) grade and exclusive source of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (“**MSCs**”), the foundation for producing exosomes. The acquired master cell bank contains a large volume of high-concentration MSCs at their earliest stage (Passage Zero), ensuring the cells retain their therapeutic potential and remain potent over very long usage in exosome production. These are stored and handled under stringent U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“**FDA**”) guidelines and GMP, meeting the high-quality standards for clinical use. Exosomes, naturally occurring nanoparticles derived from human MSCs, play a key role in promoting healing and regeneration. This strategic Acquisition positions NurExone to advance revenue-generating opportunities that leverage exosomes both as a therapeutic agent and as a versatile drug delivery system for targeted applications across various indications.

Dr. Lior Shaltiel, CEO of NurExone, stated: “securing this high-quality master cell bank is a pivotal milestone for NurExone. It ensures access to the raw materials essential for advancing our innovative therapies. We negotiated a fixed-price cell purchase order that enables NurExone to avoid product royalty fees for the cell line and eliminate the annual licensing fees that companies based on commercial cells typically incur as they approach clinical trials. The Acquisition reflects our commitment to delivering minimally invasive, effective therapies designed to improve patient outcomes while unlocking the potential of exosomes as a targeted drug delivery platform.”

The Acquisition was executed at a strategic time as the FDA just approved the first-ever Mesenchymal Stromal Cell-based therapy^(i). This landmark decision underscores the transformative potential of Mesenchymal Stromal Cell-based therapies and allogeneic (donor-derived, rather than patient’s own cells) treatments, paving the way for broader adoption in cell therapy applications and marking a major milestone in the field of regenerative medicine.

Yoram Drucker, Chairman of NurExone’s Board, added: “the Acquisition underscores our dedication to building a sustainable foundation for our products and the future of exosome-based therapeutics. With this resource in place, we are well-positioned to meet the growing clinical demand for innovative treatments in spinal cord, optic nerve, and other therapeutic areas as well as to collaborate with pharma companies looking to develop siRNA-based therapies which are loaded onto and delivered by our exosomes. Moreover, the ability to produce large quantities of high quality, GMP-manufactured exosomes may enable the Company to supply exosomes to companies for a wide range of applications - from dermal treatments to drug delivery development.”

**About NurExone**

NurExone Biologic Inc. is a TSX Venture Exchange (“**TSXV**”) and OTCQB listed pharmaceutical company that is developing a platform for biologically guided exosome-based therapies to be delivered, minimally invasive, to patients who have suffered Central Nervous System injuries. The Company’s first product, ExoPTEN for acute spinal cord injury, was proven to recover motor function in 75% of laboratory rats when administered intranasally. ExoPTEN has been granted Orphan Drug Designation by the FDA and European agency, European Medicines Agency. The NurExone platform technology is expected to offer novel solutions to drug companies interested in minimally invasive targeted drug delivery for other indications.

WallStreetbetsELITE,Markets Morning Re-Cap,"Today's session is really centered around key economic data. Main things you want to watch for are  U.S. inflation trends with the PPI report (Producer Price Index) to be released at 9:30 AM EST. This is important because it will give the Fed more data on the direction of inflation. Any surprise, especially in core PPI, could lead to quick re-pricing in both bond markets and growth-heavy stocks, which are particularly sensitive to rate expectations. The 10 year is already at 5%, while equities like higher rates, they generally do not like rates at 5%. 

Thee market positioning is still defensive. Gamma Exposure (GEX) across major indices is deep in negative territory, signaling a put-dominated environment. This puts market makers in a reactive stance. What does that mean? MM are selling into dips and buying into strength to maintain their hedges, creating the conditions for heightened intraday volatility (remember when you see negative gamma, that is always bad if you short vol). The SPX continues to trade in a tight range between 5,900 and 6,200, with 6,200 acting as strong call resistance and 5,900 serving as put support. 

NVIDIA is a bit different. It is showing positive gamma above key strikes - so high gamma low intraday vol. 

Lastly CTAs (Commodity Trading Advisors), they are cutting exposure to U.S. equities and put/call ratios climbing. They can be a big source of liquidity to the upside or downside. So worth tracking what they are doing especially when they break above or below key gamma level. 

Thoughts on your side?

WallStreetbetsELITE,Quantum fire sale - buying the dip.,"##Near term 
Near term I predict (and I'm hoping for) weak price action for stocks like RGTI, IONQ, QBTS, QUBT. Put simply, the market overreacted to Jensen Huang's comments creating a massive dip and selloff across quantum.  This is not a bad thing - it's a fantastic opportunity if you are bullish long term on this sector. 

##Base case (3-24 months) 
After further digging and DD we have CEO's of RGTI and QBTS on record saying they are ""eager"" to share their earnings, indicating growth. RGTI & IONQ partnerships with MSFT, AMZN. 

IONQ YOY keeps adding to free cash flow and improving earnings. Continued financials will propel the sector. 

##Bull case 

Multiple companies crush quarterlies, sending price action higher across the sector.  No significant news besides the companies becoming more profitable while securing more partnerships. 

##Ultra Bull case

Don't forget with a rapid accelerating sector and with so many domains of study, any point we can wake up to a shoe drop moment:

* “Quantum Breakthrough: First Practical Quantum Computer Unveiled by [Big Tech]”
* “Quantum Cybersecurity Goes Mainstream to Combat Emerging Threats”
* “Quantum Computing Hits the Cloud: Amazon and Microsoft Launch Consumer-Accessible Quantum Services”
* “Quantum Leap for Batteries: Next-Gen Materials Designed in Record Time”
* “Quantum Algorithms Achieve Financial/Economic Market Domination”

This will take quantum to next level in 2025 - Quantinium

#Price targets and buy levels:

Going to watch price action for a couple days to see if the market pushes these down further, but i'm looking to add the following tickers. 

QBTS 
*5-6 DCA, 3-5 buy in bulk 

IONQ
anything <25 is a bargain

RGTI 
Target buy $6; Similar balance sheet to iONQ

QUBT 
101% YOY growth; Target 5 or 6; Strongest growth potential stock; Riskier than IONQ D-WAVE 

QTUM  ETF

WallStreetbetsELITE,Even YOLO have to risk manage,"Some thoughts at the end of the week. Let's talk about risk management. Without a solid risk management plan, even the most popular meme trades or perfect setups will fail over time. It’s not enough to YOLO into a trade and hope it moonshots. You need to understand position sizing, stop-losses, targets, and risk-reward ratios. These are really the core tools that keep professional traders alive in the markets.

The best traders in the world are wrong more often than they are right. The difference? They don’t let one bad trade ruin their entire portfolio. When they’re wrong, they cut their losses quickly. When they’re right, they let those trades run and rack up profits. It’s not about calling the top or bottom perfectly; it’s about staying in the game long enough to win.

Think of money management like wearing a seatbelt when driving fast cars (or stocks). It won’t stop crashes, but it limits the damage when things go sideways. You don’t have to hedge every position like a hedge fund manager, but you do need to diversify your risk so that one bad trade doesn’t wipe you out. Whether you’re trading GameStop or Tesla, risk control is your lifeline.

In trading, survival = success. It’s not about hitting home runs every time — it’s about managing your risk well enough to stay in the market for the next opportunity. Don’t be the trader who goes all in, all the time. Instead, be the one who stays in the game long after the hype fades",['TSLA'],0,5,3,2025-01-10 11:28:21+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/WallStreetbetsELITE/comments/1hy2djl/even_yolo_have_to_risk_manage/,0.3522
WallStreetbetsELITE,I Bought the Dip: The 4 Small-Cap’s that I went in on with Big Growth Potential in 2025,"1. Lantronix, Inc. (NASDAQ: LTRX)

I already held Lantronix but bought more yesterday, it has been quietly building momentum, and yesterday’s market dip was the perfect time to act. Back in early December when I first mentioned it, the stock was under $3, and it’s been steadily climbing since. This isn’t just market noise—Lantronix is delivering real innovation and executing on its growth strategy.

Their Percepxion™ Edge AI Platform, built with Qualcomm, is already enabling real-time AI processing for smart cities, healthcare, and industrial IoT. Now, they’re showing how their technologies can address completely new verticals.

Big Announcement Before CES: This week, Lantronix announced a partnership with GWACS Defense to bring a military-grade gunshot detection system to the commercial market. Using their Open-Q™ 8250CS System on Module (SOM), based on Qualcomm’s QCS8250 chip, this system enables real-time acoustic detection powered by AI. It’s a game-changer for public spaces like schools, hospitals, and entertainment venues, showcasing how Lantronix’s new technologies can pivot into unexpected but critical industries.

This development is a perfect example of how Lantronix is combining its acquired and internally developed capabilities to create innovative solutions. The gunshot detection system also highlights the scalability of their platform and its potential to address diverse market needs.

This Week’s Highlights: In addition to the announcement, Lantronix is hosting a private suite for clients and investors at CES, where they’re showcasing their roadmap and vision for the future. Moves like this show they’re serious about growth and building confidence in their long-term story.

With a low price-to-sales ratio (0.88), delayed federal contracts from last year expected to roll in soon, and cutting-edge innovations like the gunshot detection system, Lantronix is one of the most exciting under-the-radar plays in IoT and edge computing right now.

2. Aeva Technologies (NYSE: AEVA)

I’ve been watching and finally went in with Shares and warrants. Aeva is breaking new ground in autonomous technology with its latest innovation, the Atlas Ultra. Announced at CES 2025, this is the slimmest long-range 4D LiDAR sensor on the market, designed for autonomous driving at highway speeds. The Atlas Ultra is a game-changer for vehicle manufacturers, combining high performance, a sleek form factor, and seamless integration for future autonomous systems.

CES 2025 Spotlight: Aeva is showcasing the Atlas Ultra at CES this week, putting them in front of key industry players and highlighting their leadership in LiDAR innovation.

Short Squeeze Setup: With nearly 6% of the float shorted and a days-to-cover ratio of 5.2, Aeva is well-positioned for a short squeeze if products like the Atlas Ultra gain traction or lead to new partnerships.

Why Trump’s Policies Could Help: Tariffs on competing foreign LiDAR technologies or components could make Aeva’s U.S.-designed and manufactured solutions more cost-competitive, especially for U.S. automakers and industrial clients.

For those looking for speculative upside, Aeva’s warrants (AEVA-WT) offer a low-cost, leveraged way to bet on their success.

3. Beam Global (NASDAQ: BEEM)

I’ve been watching and finally went in with Shares. Beam Global’s recent performance shows its ability to adapt in a tough market, and it’s shaping up to be a strong play for 2025. While the company saw a 30% revenue drop in Q3 2024, it significantly improved its gross margin from 1.7% to 10.7%, delivering a net income of $1.3 million and an EPS of $0.09—blowing past analyst expectations.

The revenue decline wasn’t due to demand—it was from order delays related to certification requirements. Those deferred orders are likely to bolster future quarters, and the improved margins position Beam for higher profitability even as revenue rebounds.

2025 Catalysts: Beam has a $200 million pipeline, including demand for new products like their BeamSpot™ curbside EV charger and wireless/inductive EV ARC™ technology. These products hit the mark for urban and consumer needs, and with expanded international presence, strategic partnerships, and compliance with the Build America, Buy America (BABA) Act, Beam is set to capitalize on both domestic and global opportunities.

Build America, Buy America Compliance: Beam Global’s products already comply with the Build America, Buy America (BABA) Act, which gives them a competitive edge when bidding for federal and municipal projects. Tariffs on imported solar panels or EV charging components from foreign manufacturers could make Beam’s U.S.-manufactured solutions more attractive to domestic buyers.

Short Squeeze Potential: Nearly 10% of BEEM’s float is shorted, and with a days-to-cover ratio of 3.06, any big wins—like order rebounds or new contracts—could send the stock moving fast.

Beam’s mix of innovation, profitability improvements, and strong positioning in the EV infrastructure market makes it a great pick for the year.

4. Triller Group (NASDAQ: ILLR)

I’ve been watching and finally went in with Shares and warrants. This one’s riskier, but it has potential. Triller’s launching a new app this month, and they’ve brought in Sean Kim (former Head of Product at TikTok) to lead the charge. That’s a solid leadership move for a company looking to shake up short-form video and the creator economy.

They’re also growing in other areas, like their AI-driven Brain Suite for personalized marketing and TrillerTV for live events. They’re aiming for a piece of the $180 billion creator economy market, and if they execute well, this could be a surprise winner in 2025.

For speculative investors, Triller’s warrants (ILLRW) offer a lower-cost higher reward way to bet on the company’s success. ILLRW warrants allow leveraged exposure to Triller’s upside potential and could see significant gains if the stock performs well this year.

Another note that may significantly benefit Triller, the Supreme Court is hearing the PAFCA case tomorrow. I expect the Supreme Court to uphold the divestiture requirement under PAFACA, as it provides a middle-ground solution that addresses national security concerns without banning TikTok outright, preserving users’ First Amendment rights. The Court tends to defer to Congress on matters of national security, especially when laws, like PAFACA, offer a path to protect constitutional rights through divestiture. While TikTok’s argument about speculative threats and free speech is strong, the lack of a total ban and the government’s broad authority in foreign policy make divestiture a proportional response. A close ruling, likely 6-3 or 5-4, will probably validate the government’s position. Once the Court rules, a temporary ban could begin shortly after the January 19, 2025, deadline if divestiture is not completed on time. This ban would remain in effect until divestiture is finalized and the new “TicTok” builds new hardware and software platforms to ensure independence, a process that could take significant time.

Update on LUNR Holdings (NASDAQ: LUNR)

I’m still holding my position in Lunar, but my exit plan revolves around the IM-2 lunar mission. This event should be a major catalyst, and I’ll look to close my position shortly after the mission depending on how it plays out.

Final Thoughts:

Yesterday’s dip gave me the opportunity to finally act on these stocks I’ve been watching for weeks. With catalysts like CES buzz, new market opportunities, improving profitability, and short squeeze potential, LTRX, AEVA, BEEM, and ILLR all have the potential to make 2025 a great year.

WallStreetbetsELITE,Gaybear short Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ: SBUX) ,"### Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ: SBUX)

#### Investment Thesis
Starbucks is facing a multitude of headwinds. The company's labor issues, tariffs, and increasing competition will be too much for the new CEO to overcome. Starbucks' strong brand has been tarnished, resulting in boycotts. The coffee quality is often criticized as subpar. Increasing debt levels warrant caution, and Starbucks could be forced to reduce dividends.

#### Risks
- **Economic Downturn**: A global economic slowdown could impact consumer spending on premium beverages.
- **Competition**: The coffeehouse market is highly competitive, with numerous players vying for market share.
- **Supply Chain Issues**: Disruptions in the supply chain could affect Starbucks' ability to maintain consistent product quality and availability.
- **Debt and Liquidity**: Starbucks has been increasing its long-term debt, nearly doubling it between 2019 and 2021.
- **Tariffs and Geopolitical Tensions**: Ongoing tariffs and geopolitical tensions, particularly with China, could lead to increased costs and reduced market access, further impacting Starbucks' profitability.

#### Conclusion
Starbucks remains a high-risk opportunity, with dwindling growth prospects and an increasingly competitive market. Based on current analyst ratings and financial performance, a price target range of $75 to $85 over the 12 months.","['SBUX', 'SBUX', 'SBUX', 'SBUX', 'SBUX', 'SBUX', 'SBUX', 'SBUX', 'SBUX']",5,5,3,2025-01-09 17:28:27+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/WallStreetbetsELITE/comments/1hxi39f/gaybear_short_starbucks_corporation_nasdaq_sbux/,0.3582

WallStreetbetsELITE,QUIK: My Top Long-Term Conviction Stock for 2025 ,"Full Disclaimer: I own 6000 shares!!

Here’s why I believe $QUIK is set to outperform in 2025 and beyond. The company has flipped profitable, secured major contracts, and has multiple growth drivers in defense, AI, and post-quantum cryptography. Let’s dive in:

🛰 1. Weaponization of Space – A Massive 2025 Theme

$QUIK is the ONLY pure play in the emerging space war defense sector.

Specializes in radiation-hardened chips for satellites and defense applications.

Secured $33M in defense contracts so far (from a potential $72M).

💡 Key Catalyst: Their main competitor, FlexLogic, just exited the market after being acquired by $ADI, leaving $QUIK as the sole provider of eFPGA IP for advanced nodes (Intel 18A & US Military). 

🔐 2. Post-Quantum Cryptography (Future-Proof Tech)

$QUIK’s partnership with Xiphera gives them quantum-secure capabilities for defense applications.

NIST Validation: Xiphera’s post-quantum cryptography just passed NIST standards, a game-changer for adoption.

Massive Opportunity: This tech could be as impactful as AI, yet it’s flying under the radar!

🤖 3. Agentic AI

Through their subsidiary SensiML, $QUIK is developing Agentic AI tools to revolutionize edge AI.

New Partnerships: Collaborations with $ARM and efabless signal strong momentum.

This part of the business is currently for sale which could generate a big cash sale given the current AI hype.  The CEO said they are receiving so many inbounds for their core eFPGA product that they want to sell Sensi and fully focus on that. 


💵 4. Financial Strength & Catalysts

Profitable on a non-GAAP basis with improving gross margins (60-61%).

No immediate need for fundraising (cash per share: $1.47).


Catalyst Watchlist:

Mid-7 figure IP contract expected in Q1 2025 (was delayed in Q3 for expanded scope).

$164M contract funnel (exceeds current market cap!).

📈 5. High Short Interest = Potential Squeeze
17% short interest (2.35M shares) creates a huge opportunity for a squeeze with positive catalysts.

💡 Why $QUIK?

$QUIK offers diverse exposure to 3 MAJOR THEMES for 2025:

Space War Defense: Leadership in radiation-hardened eFPGAs.

Post-Quantum Cryptography: A future-proof solution for security in a quantum world.

Agentic AI

With strategic partnerships (Intel, Honeywell, Northrup Grumman, BAE, etc.), a strong balance sheet, and a packed catalyst timeline, $QUIK is my top conviction play for 2025!

🚨 TL;DR
$QUIK is leading the charge in space defense, quantum cryptography, and AI while being profitable with major contracts secured and more on the horizon. Strong balance sheet + high short interest + clear catalysts = 🚀 potential.

WallStreetbetsELITE,It's Joever for NoVideo,"Claimer: I am an elite rationalist homo-logicus and epistemologically transcend most beings.

I have previously become rich by buying AyyMD when it was a penny stock and was obviously too big to fail.

One of my prior thesis for AMD long term supremacy nearly a decade ago, came from a realization that semantically derive from biology, the concept of the dGPU, is semantically akin to being a parasite that depends and feeds (electricity) on its host, the PC.

Instead APU supremacy was expected to come because the iGPU is an endosymbiont both through die sharing (reduced costs) and unified memory (HSA, etc) (not on the die means you *die*).

AMD already proved this prophecy decades ago via the powerful APUs used in conslows (xbox, etc).

Most importantly, one has to consider the following, the law of universal diminishing returns,

the more time pass, the more hardware gets better (known as more Law) and the more hardware gets better, the more iGPUs gets proportionately better.

Therefore iGPUs naturally and increasingly cannibalize the ""low end"" dGPU segment that becomes obscoleted by default.

Not only that but the scaling of user needs (their benefits from moar compute) do not scale proportionately to performance scaling. The gap in superfluousness is non-linearly exploding. We are entering the era where iGPU can aim at 2K gaming, and do all needs for 99% of use cases, the resolution of screens, the refresh rate and the compute needs of video games are inherently stagnating, because we have reached the limits of the human experience (human hardware such as pigment density in the eyes).

Nothing will reverse this fact except maybe transhumanist startups. Not only that but compute needs for most users are actually even lowering (avx512 leverage, next gen DLSS, etc)

Hence the concept of dGPU, especially of higher than midrange, low margin dGPU are becoming increasingly obscolete to user needs, in real-time.

BTW in case you were out of the loop intel has currently the best dGPU

[https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/intel-arc-b580-review-the-new-usd249-gpu-champion-has-arrived](https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/intel-arc-b580-review-the-new-usd249-gpu-champion-has-arrived)

Anyway iGPU have cannibalized dGPUs for 99% of needs meaning the marketshare of Nvidia is in an existential crisis, a parasite bordering extinction.

Okay enough snark for today, let's be a bit more serious and respectuous towards the NVDA greater foolers,

iGPU are undeniably the future blah blah and indeed AMD and intel will cease to exist versus Qualcomm PC, which is maximally ironic for the elite nerds that will recognize that their Adrenos are an anagram of Radeon.

But this is old (but gold) news, we have a bigger problem at hands: what is this timeline? The AI hype train has made Nvidia the most valued enterprise in the solar system!

Sorry to say but self-prophetically inducing Nvidia a ponzi exponential growth is not a guarantee to achieving Singularity (exponential AI growth), actually there is nothing singular about sheep behaviour.

Making Nvidia the most valued stock, if we assume (indeed a meme) that stock valuation are non purely fictional insanity but stems from somewhat expected future gain realization, then it means we expect very significant and durable profit for Nvidia, including more leather jacket than ever (no jacket and it would be racket).

So in your brains, it needs to make sense, so you implicitly invoke, necessarilly, the following premises:

1. Ai singularity or at least mass market value, will come soon**™**

Issue is that the value of actions are supposed to be an implicit ""consensus"" on expected future valuation but there is no consensus as to *when* we expect the returns..

2) Ai mass market value (AI disruption) will require mass compute that only Nvidia can provide

It's actually two premises in one, and is utterly flawed and stems from extreme ignorance about the basic concepts,

1. AI does NOT require ""mass compute"" mostly only training does which is ridiculous, one has to understand that you only train a model *once* (until we invent continual learning), and then you duplicate the model and actually starts to *use* it, via *inference*. Inference is dumb floating point multiplication and only require low amount of compute (except for the minority of use cases that require an LLM output speed faster than a human reading speed).

That's it, for the eternity of mankind history until this planet dies, you will have only needed to train your LLM once, to be used for an infinite number of humans and for an infinite number of time.

Even training at LLM takes an extremely low amount of compute time, generally an LLM takes only a few days of training. Those process are simultaneously conceptually extremely bruteforce-like/inefficient and yet our hardware has become so ineptly powerful that training require a low amount of hardware.

Not only that, but one has crucially to understand that compute is fungible (unlike trump cards) this means you can elastically distribute it, clusterize and reuse it via clouds to centralize costs and maximise hardware use.

Now you can empircally falsify my thesis about training, by quoting that indeed most novideo dGPUs are sold out (mainly via enterprises) but this basic trivial rebuttal is not sufficent to sustain your greater fool ataraxia. For the following possible reasons:

1. have you even considered that there might be a meta-bubble? (are they stupid?) A bubble withing the bubble, feeding it until it burst? It might simply be that GAFAM enterprises over-bought hardware for their needs, and that they only use 1% of what they acquired, based on FOMO on exponential growth of LLMs?

If so, such an overdemand is intrinsically transient.

2) Scalability only goes so far, people have forgotten what was the peak of the (public) LLM size increase, in was PaLM, 540 billions wide, in 2022 (decades old in AI world)

We are stagnating, second most well known largest model being LLAMA 3.1 405 billions.

Have you heard news about Llama 3.3 405 billion parameters ? A radio silence that is deafening for your thesis. Not only are there no mention of upcoming larger LLMs, but we are going in the reverse direction and we are doing it **fast**.

Llama 3.3 70B match the performance of Llama 405 billions, so you have in one year the same or better performance at **570%** less compute/dGPU needs.

Nvidia action should have proportionately lowered by 570% the day this was announced, if the market was not in reality denial.

That's even without leveraging the further considerable compute reductions from 1.58 bits quantization, mixture of experts, and so many other innovations. There has also been extreme advance in small LLMs that become competitive with large ones (microsoft PHI-4, etc)

Anyway, enough about training, the idea that research teams would drive hardware demand ad infinitum is remarkably inept, the only hope for sustained mass demand of gpus comes from inference, the actual act of using LLMs.

Here's the thing about inference, not only is it highly efficient and even more quantizable, and there has been considerable advance in caching technologies, but the premise that it requires high end compute is inept and a delusion.

Inference is clearly, ridiculously not starved on gpu compute power, but instead is starved on the total quantity of VRAM and to a much lower extent, by VRAM speed.

In other words, for people that actually understand reality, it instantaneously give the insight that inference is utterly off topic with Nvidia and AMD. It is a **fatal logic error** not to realize that LLM hardware demand is not GPUs but is towards VRAM makers such as SK hynix.

Also reminder for the tech literates that AMD graciously gave, with my money for free, to all Nvidia peasants, the specs of the internally developped HBM while N utterly failed playing with cubes. Nvidia is basically still alive because of my and others shareholders *charity*.

And yet Nvidia has until now, lived and milked us with this absurd misanthropic evil artificial product segmentation of gatekeeping cards with ridiculously low and non-upgreadable amounts of VRAM, *despite* LPDDR5X being extremely cheap.

Apple was the first to show us the light, with the M books having fast unified 128GB VRAM, with what ?

SAY THE LINE!

With their iGPU!

Now apple ecosystem is rotten to the core because they are the pinnacle of mediocrity, however in terms of hardware it is foreshadowing the impending iGPU supremacy.

The absolute ultimate humiliation is coming,

indeed the end of the gatekeeping product segmentation is imminent, AMD has announced its next APU:

[https://wccftech.com/amd-ryzen-ai-max-strix-halo-ultimate-ai-pc-apus-16-zen-5-40-rdna-3-5-cores-256-gbps-bandwidth-120w/](https://wccftech.com/amd-ryzen-ai-max-strix-halo-ultimate-ai-pc-apus-16-zen-5-40-rdna-3-5-cores-256-gbps-bandwidth-120w/)

it is basically free and has 96GB of VRAM, meaning it can fit for free, larger LLMs than the H series gpus that costs tens of thousands of dollars!!

The token speed is not state of the art but still is largely sufficent for you know, mass market, for end users local LLMs without APIs.

This is quad channel which is an artificial limitation, AMD already sell octochannel Threadripper CPUs, meaning they can sell an APU with twice the speed.

This is why Nvidia panic responded with the announcement of their own high GB VRAM APU

[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337530/nvidia-ces-digits-super-computer-ai](https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337530/nvidia-ces-digits-super-computer-ai)

You might believe, okay Nvidia saved face but actually it is primordial to understand that by doing so, they are cannibalizing their own segmented ultra high margin market with considerably cheaper high VRAM products. This is the beginning of the end for the high margin high VRAM GPUs era.

Combined with everything aforementioned and deepseek MoE technology that considerably reduce API costs, and AMD software finally becoming bearable for running pytorch, the Nvidia ivory tower is terminally crumbling.

Unless you have precise technical arguments as to why compute scalability should bypass all this (e.g. is test-time training compute heavy?) AND wether Nvidia has actually tangible long term unique differentiating proposition values (leather jacket is not enough) then I shall conclude how I started:

It's Joever.

WallStreetbetsELITE,Interesting comment by Jensen Huang (NVIDIA Ceo) yesterday and why $QNCCF actually can stand out in the QC realm.,"So Jensen basically just highlighted exactly where quantum computing shines: small data, massive compute problems, and stuff like true random number generation and cryptography. That's when Quantum eMotion (QNCCF) comes in; quantum-safe encryption and generating **true random numbers** for secure data.

This feels like a low-key win for $QNCCF (Still flying under the radar and even if QC comes in 15-20 years, framework for QC Cybersecurity would still have to start asap). IMO, Jensen's comments indirectly validate the kind of tech they're working on. As quantum computing gets more real, the need for quantum-safe encryption is only gonna explode (hello, post-quantum cybersecurity). And $QNCCF is positioned right in that sweet spot.

TL;DR: Huang’s shoutout to quantum’s strengths (randomness + cryptography) aligns perfectly with $QNCCF’s focus. If this tech becomes mainstream, $QNCCF could get some serious tailwinds. Definitely one to keep an eye on.

Incoming Catalyst:

**IBM Testbed**: Could drive major attention toward quantum-safe encryption tech. (Early Q1 2025) against IBM Quantum One Qiskit framework, proving their tech can withstand QC attacks.

**Sentry-Q Sales**: Sales announcement in healthcare/telemedicine adoption (secured quantum communication).

**Microchip Progress**: Their quantum random number generator chip commercialization/development announcement.

Nebius Group ($NBIS) is your golden fuckin’ ticket. It IS AI cloud infrastructure, and it’s still at the ground floor. At a $7B market cap and $30/share, this powerhouse hasn’t already exploded like some other names we’ve seen being shilled in the group —it’s primed for growth.

Here’s why you’ll regret sitting on the sidelines:

🚀Short-Term Potential: Nebius’ revenue is growing at 70% YoY, targeting $500M–$1B by 2025. Even a conservative 15x revenue multiple would push its valuation to $15B, or ~$65/share in the near term—doubling your money.

🚀Mid-Term Moonshot: The AI cloud market is projected to hit $260B by 2030, and Nebius is positioned to capture 10% market share with its global expansion. That’s a $60B market cap or ~$260/share, a 9x return from current levels.

🚀Massive Backing: Jensen Huang & NVIDIA, Accel, and Orbis just poured over $700M into Nebius at a premium, funding global expansion and enterprise-grade AI infrastructure. When NVIDIA is betting on a company, you should take notice. Good enough for Jensen, good enough for me. 

🚀It’s Still Early: Nebius is fresh off its spin-off from Yandex. Unlike overhyped stocks that have already rallied 1500%, Nebius is still at ground level.

With AI adoption accelerating, a no-debt balance sheet, and $2B cash on hand, this company is set to skyrocket. Don’t wait for it to hit $100+ to start paying attention.

$NBIS to $15B soon. $60B later.

# Alphabet Slides After Cloud Sales Fall Short of Expectations

Alphabet just reminded investors that even tech giants can trip. The company’s fourth-quarter revenue landed at $96.5 billion—just shy of expectations—but the real disappointment came from Google Cloud. The division pulled in $12 billion, missing forecasts and raising concerns about whether AI-driven cloud growth is slowing down. Investors didn’t take it well. Shares tumbled over 9% in after-hours trading, wiping out much of this year’s gains.

**Big AI Bets, Bigger Bills**  
  
While cloud struggled, Alphabet is doubling down on AI. The company announced a jaw-dropping $75 billion in capital expenditures for 2025, blowing past Wall Street’s $58 billion estimate. That cash will fund data centers and infrastructure to power AI ambitions, giving a nice boost to chip supplier Broadcom, whose shares popped 6%. But with rivals like OpenAI and DeepSeek proving they can build AI models for far less, Alphabet’s spending spree is raising eyebrows.

**Search Still Reigns, But Challenges Mount**  
  
Despite the cloud miss, Google’s core business held strong. Search advertising raked in $54 billion, edging past estimates, while YouTube brought in $10.5 billion—helped by a surge in election-year podcast ads. Meanwhile, Waymo and other experimental projects in Alphabet’s “Other Bets” segment fell flat, reporting just $400 million in revenue, well below expectations. Investors are increasingly questioning whether these moonshot ventures are worth the money.

Beyond earnings, Alphabet is facing growing regulatory headaches. U.S. and Chinese regulators are circling, with lawsuits targeting its search dominance and ad practices. At the same time, AI challengers are nipping at Google’s heels, with OpenAI now embedding real-time search capabilities into ChatGPT. For now, Alphabet is stuck balancing massive AI investments, legal fights, and investor jitters. Whether all that spending translates into long-term dominance—or just thinner margins—remains the trillion-dollar question.

# Market Movements

* 📉 **Tariff Uncertainty Puts the Fed in a Bind**: The Federal Reserve faces a dilemma as Trump's tariffs threaten to both raise inflation and slow GDP growth. Economists project tariffs could shave 1.2% off growth while adding 0.7% to core inflation, potentially forcing the Fed to delay rate cuts or pivot later in the year ($SPX).
* 📉 **U.S. Job Openings Drop Sharply in December**: Job openings fell to 7.6 million, the lowest level since September and below expectations of 8 million. The decline was driven by drops in professional services, education, and finance, though hiring and quit rates held steady. The Fed is watching the labor market closely for signs of cooling ($SPX).
* 🚘 **GM Slashes 50% of Cruise Staff After Robotaxi Exit**: General Motors is laying off half of Cruise’s workforce following its decision to shut down the robotaxi business. The move comes after GM spent over $10 billion on Cruise, which faced regulatory scrutiny and leadership failures before halting operations ($GM).
* 📱 **Apple Launches 'Invites' App to Take on Partiful**: Apple introduced a new event-planning app called 'Apple Invites,' allowing users to create and manage RSVPs. The app requires an iCloud+ subscription, integrating AI features for automated invitations. The move expands Apple’s services strategy amid growing subscription revenue ($AAPL).
* 🚗 **Tesla’s Market Share Plummets in Scandinavia**: Tesla lost ground in Sweden and Norway, with January registrations dropping 44% and 38% year-over-year despite overall auto sales rising. Public sentiment toward the brand soured following Elon Musk’s political remarks, cutting Tesla’s market share in Sweden to 2.1% and in Norway to 7.4% ($TSLA).
* 📉 **Vanguard Slashes Fees, Pressuring Rivals**: Vanguard is cutting fees on 87 U.S. funds by an average of 20%, saving investors $350 million this year. The move, its largest-ever fee reduction, ramps up pressure on competitors like BlackRock and Fidelity ($BLK).
* 🕶️ **Meta Nears $100 Billion in VR Investments**: Meta is set to surpass $100 billion in total spending on VR and smart glasses, allocating another $20 billion to Reality Labs this year. Despite generating $2.1 billion in 2024 revenue, the unit posted a staggering $17.7 billion operating loss. Meta is now shifting its focus toward AI-powered Ray-Ban smart glasses over its metaverse ambitions ($META).

# Echelon Of Earnings From AMD, Chipotle, Snapchat

**AMD’s Data Center Miss Overshadows Strong Earnings**  
  
AMD delivered a solid earnings beat, but investors were fixated on a shortfall in its data center business. The chipmaker posted $7.66 billion in revenue, surpassing expectations, yet its crucial data center unit fell short, reporting $3.86 billion instead of the projected $4.14 billion. Despite a 69% year-over-year jump in data center sales—driven by AI chip demand—Wall Street wanted more. Shares dropped 5% in extended trading. CEO Lisa Su remains optimistic, forecasting strong double-digit growth in 2025 as AMD scales its AI chip business, but for now, the market isn’t buying in.

**Chipotle’s Forecast Sours Otherwise Strong Earnings**  
  
Chipotle kept the burritos rolling with solid Q4 earnings, but its outlook left investors with indigestion. The company posted $2.85 billion in revenue, matching estimates, while earnings per share came in slightly ahead. Traffic remained strong, up 4% year over year, and the brand continued outpacing the broader restaurant industry. However, a lukewarm 2025 same-store sales forecast of low- to mid-single-digit growth disappointed Wall Street, leading to a 3% drop in after-hours trading. Chipotle remains bullish on expansion, planning to open up to 345 new locations—most featuring drive-thru “Chipotlanes”—but investors were hoping for a bigger growth story.

**Snap Pops on Earnings Beat, But Guidance Disappoints**  
  
Snap’s stock jumped after the social media company reported a rare earnings win, with revenue climbing 14% to $1.56 billion and daily active users hitting 453 million—both ahead of expectations. The company even turned a profit, a major turnaround from last year’s loss. However, the celebration was short-lived as Snap’s Q1 guidance underwhelmed, with projected earnings below analyst expectations. The company cited increased investment spending, legal costs, and a seasonal marketing shift as key factors. While its Snapchat+ subscription service continues to gain traction, adding 2 million subscribers in Q4, Snap still faces regulatory scrutiny and heavy competition from Meta and TikTok.  


# Trump Signs Order to Create U.S. Sovereign-Wealth Fund

President Trump is making big moves again—this time by signing an executive order to create a U.S. sovereign wealth fund. The goal? Monetize America’s balance sheet, invest in national projects, and, according to Trump, maybe even play a role in securing a deal for TikTok.

At an Oval Office ceremony, Trump framed the fund as a game-changer for U.S. economic strategy, promising it would be “one of the biggest.” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent backed up the urgency, pledging to “stand this thing up within the next 12 months.”

**How Would It Work?**

Sovereign wealth funds aren’t new—Norway, China, and Saudi Arabia have been running them for years, leveraging oil profits and trade surpluses to bankroll investments. The U.S., however, has a slight problem: no surplus.

The government’s balance sheet is heavy on real estate and student loans but light on liquid assets, making funding a massive investment vehicle tricky. Trump floated the idea of using tariff revenue to fund the venture—though that assumes the recently delayed tariffs actually go into effect and generate enough cash.

**A New Player in Global Markets?**

If it gets off the ground, the fund would join a crowded field of government-backed investors influencing everything from infrastructure to AI. Trump’s team has hinted that it could be used to invest in manufacturing, defense, and critical supply chains, with Commerce Secretary nominee Howard Lutnick suggesting the U.S. should get equity stakes in companies it does business with—think vaccine makers and defense contractors.

**TikTok’s Wild Card Role**

Trump also hinted that the fund could somehow facilitate TikTok’s U.S. future, though the details remain murky. The president has been pushing for an American-owned TikTok spin-off and previously suggested the government itself should take a 50% stake. Whether the fund plays a role in that deal—or if it’s just Trump thinking out loud—remains to be seen.

The executive order gives officials 90 days to draft a plan detailing investment strategies, governance, and legal considerations. But without a clear funding source, it’s unclear how this fund would compete with the trillion-dollar giants already dominating the space.

# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

Tomorrow brings another check-up on the labor market with the ADP private payroll report, offering insights into hiring trends nationwide. December saw 122,000 new jobs added—solid, but a step down from November’s 146,000. Economists are cautiously optimistic about January’s numbers, with seasonal hiring expected to lend a boost.

On the earnings front, a packed slate awaits. Uber ($UBER), Arm Holdings ($ARM), MicroStrategy ($MSTR), Qualcomm ($QCOM), GSK ($GSK), Ford ($F), Toyota ($TM), Boston Scientific ($BSX), Allstate ($ALL), The New York Times ($NYT), and Harley Davidson ($HOG) are all set to unveil their latest results.

# Before Market Open: 

* **Disney’s** streaming journey has been a rocky road, but the recent merger of Fubo and Hulu + Live TV is a major win. The deal adds over 1.6 million subscribers in one swoop and clears some legal headaches. Now, the focus shifts to keeping customers hooked, turning a profit, and dealing with slowing revenue at its Asian theme parks. Consensus: $1.43 EPS, $24.7 billion in revenue. ($DIS)
* **Novo Nordisk** recently stumbled with the failure of its new weight-loss drug, CagriSema, a rare setback for the pharma giant. Shares have taken a hit over the past year, but strong sales from current blockbusters like Wegovy and Ozempic could offer a silver lining. For patient investors, this dip might present a chance to buy in at a more attractive valuation. Consensus: $0.85 EPS, $11.34 billion in revenue.

Daytrading,My takeaways from today's AMD call,"• Still best server CPU's  
• Still best gaming CPU's  
• New gaming GPU's expected early 2025  
• New HPC-AI GPU MI350X now expected sooner  
• Current MI300X have 2.7x improved inference  
• Investment towards improving AI library software  
• Increased offering of custom chips to customers  
• Maintained MI300x partnership with IBM Cloud  
• Better revenue, margins, income EPS since FY2023

Forward moving opinion: I can see gaming segment income improving in 2025 as consumers who bought GPU's 4 years ago during COVID lockdowns opt to upgrade old PC's to new ones that handle generative AI. Beyond that, client segment revenue will stay strong due to CPU dominance. Also, AMD is aware of Broadcomm and Marvell and is actively pursuing ways to cut them out with AMD's own custom AI chips. Lastly, AMD's earlier release of MI350X's will mean bigger piece of the pie for attracting more HPC-AI customers.

Eval: AMD trades 26% lower than price at EOY 2023 despite making almost double EPS in 2024. The reason why NVDA dropped 18% during DeepSeek FUD while AMD only dropped 7% is largely because AMD investors are holding strong. As a general rule, I avoid investing based on hype.

Daytrading,AMD Earnings Today 2/4/25,"NEWS: GPU and HPC-AI stock AMD releases earnings today 2/4/25. Earnings performance will be influenced by CPU/GPU sales, current demand for MI300X GPU's, and HPC-AI forecasts for Instinct MI350X GPU's (likely better value inference than NVDA) expected in H2 2025. Details below:  
  
For 2024, the best overall and gaming CPU is likely the AMD's Ryzen 7 9800X3D (better value than Intel's Core Ultra 9 285k). In addition, the most balanced CPU for work/gaming is likely AMD's Ryzen 9 7950X (better than Intel's Core i9 14900K which is MUCH less energy efficient). AMD's Ryzen 7 5700X3D is likely most flexible for upgradability (AM4 support for older MOBO).   
  
In 2024, Intel has been a huge disappointment with SUBSTANTIAL 13th and 14th generation CPU stability issues. This coupled with poor price per value leads AMD to dominate the CPU sector. Despite this, AMD has fallen largely due to reduced projected forecasts in HPC-AI after competitors began announcing making custom silicon. However, various customers still use AMD MI300X GPU's such as ORCL (Oracle Cloud Infrastructure) and IBM Cloud recently becoming a new partner deploying MI300X's expected H1 2025. It'll be interesting to see if AMD can beat the FUD and outperform today.","['AMD', 'AMD', 'AMD', 'INTC', 'AMD', 'INTC', 'AMD', 'INTC', 'AMD', 'AMD', 'AMD', 'ORCL', 'AMD']",5,1,1,2025-02-04 20:39:13+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/1ihru4l/amd_earnings_today_2425/,0.9153

# Palantir’s AI Reign Just Went Into Overdrive

**A Growth Story Even Wall Street Didn’t See Coming**  
  
Palantir just dropped an earnings report that had investors scrambling to hit the “buy” button. The data analytics firm posted a 36% jump in Q4 revenue to $828 million, smashing analyst expectations, while U.S. commercial sales skyrocketed 64%. If that wasn’t enough, CEO Alex Karp predicted “untamed organic growth” in AI demand, leading Palantir to raise its full-year revenue outlook to $3.75 billion, well above Wall Street’s $3.54 billion projection. The stock soared 22% in after-hours trading reaching $102.4, adding another chapter to its meteoric 340% rise in 2024.

**The AI War Chest Gets Bigger**  
  
Palantir has long been a Pentagon darling, and that relationship is paying dividends. U.S. government sales spiked 45% to $343 million, thanks to expanded contracts with the Army and Special Operations Command. Meanwhile, Karp’s vision for an AI-powered defense industry is taking shape—Palantir inked a partnership with AI startup Anthropic to bring its language models into U.S. intelligence operations, while deepening ties with weapons maker Anduril. Translation? Big tech and big defense are merging, and Palantir is at the center of it all.

**A Political Tailwind for Palantir**  
  
Investor enthusiasm for Palantir has surged since Trump’s return to the White House, with expectations that his administration will double down on defense spending and favor U.S. tech firms over foreign competitors. Palantir has positioned itself as a key player in this vision—Chief Technology Officer Shyam Sankar recently outlined a blueprint to revitalize U.S. manufacturing and defense technology, while Karp has been vocal about the need for the U.S. to maintain technological dominance. Citing political scientist Samuel Huntington, Karp argued that global power has historically been shaped by technological and military strength—a stance that reinforces Palantir’s role in securing America’s AI and defense future.

**What’s Next? More AI, More Government $$$**  
  
Palantir expects U.S. commercial sales to jump another 54% in 2025 and is still raking in major government contracts, including a $619 million Army deal through 2028. But it’s also navigating a shifting AI landscape, especially after China’s DeepSeek debuted an AI model that rattled U.S. tech stocks. Karp is unfazed, telling CNBC that America needs an “all-country effort” to maintain its edge. With AI, defense, and geopolitical tensions all fueling its rise, Palantir isn’t just riding the AI wave—it’s steering the ship.

# Trump Hits Pause on Canada, Mexico Tariffs—For Now

After days of economic anxiety and diplomatic back-and-forth, President Trump has agreed to pause tariffs on Canadian imports for at least 30 days, according to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. The move follows a similar one-month delay for tariffs on Mexico, with both countries making commitments to crack down on fentanyl trafficking.

The original plan? 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada, and a 10% tariff on Chinese goods, with Canadian energy products set for a slightly lower 10% levy. Now, the Canadian tariffs are on hold, with Trump saying he’ll reassess after seeing progress on border security and drug enforcement efforts.

**Canada’s Counterpunch**  
  
Trudeau wasn’t bluffing when he warned of retaliation. Canada had lined up $155 billion in counter-tariffs on U.S. goods, including beer, clothing, and household appliances. Ontario even banned U.S. liquor from shelves (sorry, Tito’s fans). The Canadian prime minister framed the tariffs as a betrayal, invoking WWII and 9/11 as moments when Canada stood with the U.S.—not exactly the tone of a friendly trade dispute.

**The Market Fallout**  
  
Investors breathed a small sigh of relief, but the market remains rattled. Goldman Sachs warned that if tariffs remain in place, S&P 500 earnings could take a 2-3% hit, with automakers, homebuilders, and consumer goods companies among the hardest hit. Car prices could rise by $3,000 on average, homebuilding costs would climb, and Super Bowl guacamole might as well be caviar with avocado prices set to skyrocket.

Meanwhile, Trump’s claim that tariffs would pressure Canada to become the 51st U.S. state (yes, he actually said that) isn’t exactly making trade negotiations smoother.

**What’s Next?** For now, Trump is giving Canada 30 days to prove it’s serious about border security and drug enforcement before tariffs go back on the table. Mexico got a similar deal after its president deployed 10,000 soldiers to its northern borderto curb fentanyl shipments.

But if Trump does move forward with tariffs in a month, this could become one of the most aggressive trade wars in modern history—one that could disrupt $1.4 trillion in trade and send shockwaves through supply chains, consumer prices, and financial markets.

Stay tuned. This saga is far from over. 

# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

The week kicks off with a spotlight on labor market data, starting with the job openings report. November's 8.1 million job openings and a 4.8% openings rate signaled a robust hiring environment, and economists are eyeing December's numbers for similar strength. But for anyone rooting for a Fed rate cut, a little softness in the data wouldn’t hurt.

Tuesday brings a heavyweight lineup of earnings from across industries. Expect updates from Pfizer ($PFE), PayPal ($PYPL), Spotify ($SPOT), PepsiCo ($PEP), Chipotle ($CMG), Snap ($SNAP), and Ferrari ($RACE), to name just a few. With so many big players reporting, Wall Street is bracing for a flurry of headlines.

# After Market Close:

Investors are eager to see if the spending spree is paying off, especially with DeepSeek stirring doubts about the necessity of such massive AI investments. And then there’s Google Search. Is ChatGPT stealing its lunch? With a reasonable valuation compared to its Magnificent 7 peers, a solid performance tomorrow could send Alphabet shares climbing. Consensus: $2.13 EPS, $96.67 billion in revenue. ($GOOGL)
* **Advanced Micro Devices** has been living in Nvidia’s shadow when it comes to AI dominance. But the latest buzz from DeepSeek—that companies might not need ultra-expensive chips to build AI models—could be AMD’s ticket to the big leagues. While it may not outbuild Nvidia, AMD’s budget-friendly chips could appeal to tech giants chasing AI cost-efficiency. Tomorrow’s results will show if AMD can capitalize on this shift.

* Australia retail sales came in better than expected. Still a decline MOM but less than expected
* Chinese Caixin Manufacturing PMI came in more or less as expected, a slight miss. Just about in expansion. 
* Manufacturing PMIs in Europe:
* All in contraction. UK, Eurozone and Germany slightly ahead of expectations, Italy and France slightly below, but more or less in line. 
* Preliminary CPI for Europe came in slightly hotter than expected. 
* Headline Inflation rate YOY came 2.5% vs 2.4% expected
* Core inflation came out 2.7% vs 2.6% expected. 
* Later we have ISM manufacturing PMI for US. 
* That's the big macro event for the day. Markets expect a return to expansion. 

TARIFF NEWS:

* Trummp signed 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada, 10% on China. framed the move as a response to illegal immigration, drug trafficking, and national security concerns, citing fentanyl as a major issue.
* Canada counter acted with a 25% tariff on $155B worth of US goods. This is, in truth rookie numbers, and Canada HAD to do this to try to save their plunging currency. I wouldn't read too much into this. Seems totally unviable to go to war on tariffs with US given their reliance on exports to US. This will likely be resolved in negotiation.
* EY note that the US impact of the tariffs to inflation will be 0.7% in Q1, and 0.4% in 2025. They said the inflation would be transitory as demand destruction and hawkish fed would be disinflationary. 
* They said that since 80% of Mexican exports go to US and exports are 40% of their economy, Real GDP impact will be 1.6% in 2025 and 4.5% in 2026. Canada GDP impact will be 2.7% in 2025 and 4.3% in 2026. 
* JPM model estimates suggest that a sustained 25% US tariff will be severe enough to push Mexico and Canada into recession. Now sees Mexican recession as base case, following the Tariffs. 
* Trum-p will be meeting with Mexico and Canada PMs today - potentially leaves door open to 11th hour negotiations. 
* Instead of counter active measures, WSJ reports the China are ready to propose a deal with US, including a pledge to not devalue the yuan, an offer to make more investments in the U.S and a commitment to reduce exports of fentanyl precursors. This is a big positive. 
* China had however mentioned that they will file a complaint to WTO in response to the tariffs. 
* Trum-p’s latest tariffs on China, Canada, and Mexico include eliminating the ""de minimis"" exemption, which allowed goods under $800 to enter the U.S. tariff-free—a major hit to Chinese e-commerce giants like PDD's TEmU and Stein. They have used this loophole to flood cheap imports. 
* If Trum-p’s 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada and 10% on China get fully passed down to consumers, and in the worst-case scenario where buyers don’t switch to U.S.-made goods, ING estimates the added cost could be $835 per person or $3,242 per family of four, based on the latest trade data.
* China makes up nearly 30% of all U.S. apparel imports, and Bloomberg Intelligence estimates clothing prices could rise up to 2% for brands that depend heavily on Chinese manufacturers.
* Nearly half of U.S. auto parts imports come from Canada & Mexico, and American automakers rely on those supplies. That could mean higher costs for new cars and repairs.
* Tr-ump says tariffs on Europe will be next.

* Dollar was significantly higher at first, has pared some of those gains. 
* Bond yields are not particularly higher though with is a fact that perhaps the market is not seeing the tariffs s totally credible.
* Gold also was lower in overnight trading, has now recovered higher. Gold should see higher pressures under tariffs.

Daytrading,Any Advice Please guys?,"Hey guys,

I’ve been paper trading Tesla options (some Gold and Nvidia) for about 3/4 months in the UK (using market mirrors contracts for each trade) and managed to do around 31k in profit!

I downloaded each month’s data and have roughly a 68% win rate across the board! Which is great however this month January has been a disaster class and really thrown me off!

I’m super keen to go for a live account but is it possible to make any money starting from £300?

Also I feel like the paper accounts really are rigged to entice those with no knowledge into the market before they get rapidly liquidated.

Any help/advice is welcome on this thread or even via DM!","['TSLA', 'NVDA']",1,0,0,2025-02-03 02:52:20+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/1igf3jw/any_advice_please_guys/,0.8888

Daytrading,Is it just me or was January very easy to trade?,"I have been trying to incorporate news and market conditions more into my trading since I hadn’t had much success using only technical analysis.

This month has been exceptionally successful for me, with an 88% win rate (22 wins out of 25 trades). I have been primarily focusing on market trends and only taking trades when I have a solid hypothesis about what might be happening.

Here are some highlights:
- I got lucky and entered MRNA early on, expecting news about viruses to pump the stock. When the news came, I exited with an $8k profit.
- Inauguration week felt like the climax of the AI boom, so I went long on NVDA until the end of the week before exiting.
- It seemed inevitable that Trump would push the market to new highs—and we’d see headlines like “Stocks Surge to New Records as Trump Returns to the Presidency” so I took a position in that direction as well.
- During the NVDA drop, it became clear that money was being moved to other tech safe havens (especially META and AAPL). I traded around their earnings and exited during after-hours trading before their prices dropped the next day. I expected that they would at least see an initial pump, allowing the big money that had flowed in during the NVDA crash to be taken off the table.

Whenever I feel like I’ve gotten good at trading, it doesn’t take long for the market to bring me back to reality, so please slap me with reality before the market does.",['META'],490,168,107,2025-02-02 00:57:00+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1iflb5a,0.9911

# Trump Vows Tariffs On Mexico, Canada, And China to Hit Saturday With More in Coming Months

**Tariffs Incoming, No Escape Hatch**  
  
Trump’s tariff hammer is about to drop, and it’s hitting just about everything: oil, chips, steel, drugs—you name it. Starting Saturday, the U.S. will slap 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico and a 10% levy on China, all under the guise of combating illegal fentanyl and securing supply chains. And this is just the opening salvo—Trump promised even more tariffs on European goods and additional hits to key commodities by mid-February. Wall Street took notice, with markets dipping as investors braced for ripple effects.

**Trade Wars 2.0, Now with More Collateral**  
  
The biggest target? The auto industry. Modern car manufacturing is a three-country relay race, with vehicles crossing North American borders multiple times before hitting dealerships. Tariffs could send production costs skyrocketing and dent an already shaky sector. Meanwhile, the energy market is on edge—80% of Canada’s oil exports go straight to the U.S., and with refiners relying heavily on Canadian crude, any tariff-induced price spike could mean higher gas prices just as inflation was cooling off.

**Retaliation is Already in the Works**  
  
Canada and Mexico aren’t taking this lying down. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau vowed a “forceful but reasonable” response, and Mexico hinted at countermeasures that could hit U.S. automakers, agriculture, and consumer goods. A 25% duty on Mexican imports could have a multibillion-dollar impact on U.S. households, raising prices on essentials like fresh produce, meat, and electronics. Meanwhile, the EU is quietly preparing its own counterpunch, with analysts predicting a drawn-out trade fight.

**A Political and Economic Gamble**  
  
While economists warn that these tariffs could reignite inflation and disrupt supply chains, Trump isn’t fazed. He’s selling tariffs as a nationalist win, claiming they’ll “make us very rich and very strong.” The real test? Whether businesses and consumers are willing to absorb the fallout. With inflation fears still lurking and global trade partners gearing up for battle, Trump’s tariff strategy could be a high-stakes gamble that reshapes markets for months to come.

# Chili’s Is Eating Everyone’s Lunch

  
Chili’s just delivered one of the most jaw-dropping turnarounds in the restaurant industry. Brinker International’s flagship chain posted a record 31% jump in same-store sales last quarter, fueled by a 20% surge in foot traffic—a number so wild it made Wall Street do a double take. The stock soared 16% to an all-time high of $180, as the company flexed its ability to attract value-conscious diners while leaving competitors like Darden and Bloomin’ Brands in the dust.

**Marketing That Actually Works**  
  
Turns out, bombarding social media with Triple Dipper ads and a relentless push for its $10.99 “3 for Me” deal pays off. Chili’s doubled sales of the Triple Dipper, which now accounts for 14% of total revenue, up from 7% a year ago. CEO Kevin Hochman says competitors can try to undercut prices, but they can’t replicate the experience—especially after Chili’s revamped its menu and operations to ensure that every meal delivers.

**Less Is More in the Kitchen**  
  
Chili’s didn’t just throw money at ads; it cleaned up its entire back-of-house. The chain cut 13 menu items and 12 pantry SKUs, making way for quality upgrades like fresh-made guac, better chicken, and crispier wings. Meanwhile, a new kitchen display system and TurboChef ovens have made cooking more efficient, allowing staff to handle the flood of new customers without missing a beat. Even It’s Just Wings, Chili’s virtual brand, got streamlined—ditching its dedicated kitchen station to free up space for high-growth menu items.

**What’s Next? More Growth, More Margs**  
  
With demand booming, Brinker raised its full-year revenue outlook for the second time in three months, now forecasting $5.15B-$5.25B in sales. Hochman is already planning 200 Chili’s remodels to make locations even more inviting. And for those worried about inflation? The $6 margarita is here to stay. As far as turnarounds go, this one isn’t just working—it’s a masterclass in how to win over price-conscious diners while keeping margins intact.

Daytrading,"8th month trading: +1816 , huge unrealized lose $10,853","If you've been following my journey, you would've notice that my paper looks different. I've been using Hermes unlined paper which used to cost $60 a notebook, but I ran out and they increased the price to $80 which is too rich for my blood. I had to switch to using a cheap Amazon $11 substitute.


The running out of paper was probably a foreshadowing of me running out of money this month. 😅 I didn't stick to my rules and screwed up royalty. I had it coming, can't blame anyone but my own lack of discipline.

Up until the 17th, I was doing great. 44% yearly return. I think it got to my head. Fidelity hasn't updated for the 31st but now I'm probably sitting around 20% yearly return. 😭

Rules broken: 
1. Buying into a down trending stock: Morning of the 18th, I'm looking at Walmart, nvida, reddit, and elf. Elf was the only one in the red but was cheap, I can buy more shares. I didn't plan to hold, a quick in and out. Well I bought in at 123 stock goes towards my target price 124 which I moved because then I added in more shares. The price drops. I was still in profit but it was small so I didn't sell out. Then it fell below break even. I was still stubborn and refused to sell out even when it came a little above break even again. I thought, eh next day it will go to target price. Next day it plummeted. Did I sell? No! Figured just a pull back. Eventually, it went down to 101. Then started to go up to 108 but kept selling off. I asked myself if i should just sell at 108 since it has a hard time going up but the lost was so great so i convinced myself that it was just building support. We'll now we're at 31st, the stock went down to $99  and I'm still holding at close to $11K lost. 🤦‍♀️

I did this to myself because the holding strategy only works on trending up stocks and this stock was already falling when I bought in.

So what now? 
I got 3 options. Feel free to advise.

#1: hold until profit (who knows when that will be)

#2: sell now, as trump tariff kicks in tomorrow and earning is in 5 days, they might miss earnings which will make this situation even worst.

#3: sell half, hold half.

Still thinking about these options as I hate to sell at a lost and we are at a critical level. The stock is almost hitting 52 weeks low of $98. The next level down would be $92 if $99 don't hold.

Daytrading,First ORB strategy on Tesla options - 260 profit,"Hello,

I’m a small cap momentum trader but learned of the ORB strategy because  I was curious about trading large cap options.

I drew a vertical line at the 15 minute mark into the market opening, and marked and high and the low of the candles within those 15 minutes. 

After the price broke through the high of the ORB range, it retested the high as the support and once it held I bought a 0 DTE and rode the momentum up for a good profit. 

This was my first time doing ORB after back testing. Looking forward to live testing a little bit more while the small cap market recovers from the cooldown. 

Does anyone trade ORB ? Yes I think I got lucky today for sure.

# Apple iPhone Sales Shrink Slightly as Investors Await AI Payoff

  
Apple’s latest earnings were a classic case of “good enough.” Revenue climbed 4% to $124.3 billion, but iPhone sales dipped nearly 1% to $69.1 billion—marking yet another quarter where flashy AI features failed to spark an upgrade frenzy. Investors shrugged it off, sending shares up 3% after hours, thanks to Apple’s Services division. The segment, which includes the App Store, Apple Music, and iCloud, hit a record $26.3 billion in revenue, proving that if people won’t buy new iPhones, they’ll at least keep paying for storage and subscriptions.

**China Fumbles, AI Stumbles**  
  
Apple’s China problem isn’t going away. Revenue from the region cratered 11% to $18.5 billion as domestic brands like Huawei surged ahead. Tim Cook blamed “inventory reductions” for the slump, but the real issue? Apple Intelligence hasn’t launched in China, leaving its iPhones looking second-rate against AI-powered local competition. The fix? Apple plans to roll out Chinese-language AI in April, but whether that move will actually win back market share is TBD.

**Tariffs, Trump, and Trouble**  
  
Beyond China, Apple is bracing for Trump-era tariffs 2.0, with the administration mulling new levies on Chinese imports. Last time, Cook managed to schmooze his way out of hefty tariffs—he even made an appearance at Trump’s inauguration last week. But with Apple still manufacturing most of its products in China, a trade war could throw a wrench into margins. Meanwhile, Apple’s decision to sit out the AI spending arms race is looking smarter by the day, as rivals like Microsoft and Google face Wall Street backlash for runaway costs.

**The AI Waiting Game**  
  
Apple’s AI rollout has been... underwhelming. The much-hyped Apple Intelligence features haven’t moved the needle, and early issues—like botched notification summaries—haven’t helped. While Cook insists Apple’s ecosystem will make its AI the best in the long run, consumers aren’t exactly rushing to upgrade. Investors are still buying the vision, but if Apple wants AI to be more than a talking point, it needs to start delivering results.

# UPS to Amazon: “It’s Not Me, It’s You”’

UPS just pulled a classic “we need to talk” on Amazon, slashing its business with the e-commerce giant by more than 50% by 2026. The reason? Amazon might be its biggest customer, but it’s also its least profitable. UPS would rather focus on high-margin shipments, even if it means losing billions in revenue. Investors, however, weren’t sold on the plan—shares cratered 14%, their worst drop since 2008.

**Amazon Shrugs, UPS Scrambles**  
  
While UPS is downsizing its Amazon deal, Amazon has spent the past decade building its own logistics empire, so it’s hardly sweating the breakup. In fact, it had even offered to ship more with UPS, but the courier declined, choosing to prioritize profitability over volume. Meanwhile, FedEx made a similar move back in 2019, cutting Amazon loose and shifting focus to higher-margin clients. That strategy paid off, leaving UPS now scrambling to course-correct with cost-cutting measures and a push into more lucrative segments like healthcare and business-to-business shipping.

**Less Amazon, More Headaches**  
  
UPS is rolling out a $1 billion cost-cutting plan, closing facilities, downsizing its fleet, and cutting jobs to offset the revenue loss. It’s also ditching its last-mile delivery partnership with the U.S. Postal Service, opting to handle more deliveries in-house. While the moves are meant to boost margins, the immediate impact isn’t pretty—UPS is bracing for a revenue drop in 2025, falling short of analysts’ expectations.

**What’s Next?**  
  
CEO Carol Tomé promised more details on UPS' long-term strategy soon—maybe by the end of Q1—but for now, Wall Street isn’t convinced. The big bet is that fewer Amazon packages will mean higher margins, but in the short term, UPS is taking a financial punch to the gut. Investors are left wondering: will this be a painful but necessary pivot, or just a costly breakup?

# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

The week’s final act? A crucial inflation gut check. The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index—aka the Fed’s favorite inflation gauge—drops today, and while Jerome Powell tried to sound optimistic in yesterday’s press conference, prices are still running hotter than he’d like. If today’s data shows inflation cooling, markets will start dreaming of rate cuts in March. If not, brace for more Fed-induced suspense.

Earnings season isn’t done yet, with a fresh batch of heavyweights reporting, including Colgate-Palmolive ($CL), Church & Dwight ($CHD), AbbVie ($ABBV), Phillips 66 ($PSX), and Eaton Corporation ($ETN). Expect Wall Street to comb through the numbers for any signs of consumer fatigue or corporate pricing power—because in this economy, margins matter more than ever.

# Tesla Fourth-Quarter Results Miss Estimates As Automotive Revenue Drops 8%

Tesla’s Q4 results weren’t exactly electric—profits missed estimates, automotive revenue fell 8%, and margins shrank to 6.2%. But none of that mattered once Elon Musk started talking about Tesla’s glorious future. The stock initially dipped, then flipped positive after Musk reassured investors that 2025 will be the year Tesla returns to growth. With plans for a cheaper EV, self-driving tech, and even humanoid robots, Musk essentially told Wall Street: “Ignore the numbers, focus on the dream.”

**Self-Driving Hype and a White House Connection**  
  
Musk is doubling down on AI, telling investors that fully autonomous Teslas will hit the streets this year and that the Cybercab—a driverless taxi—will arrive in 2026. Meanwhile, his growing influence in Washington could shape Tesla’s trajectory. As one of Trump’s key advisors, Musk has a front-row seat to potential regulatory shifts that could benefit his AI and self-driving ambitions. However, Trump’s proposed tariffs on Mexican and Canadian imports could dent Tesla’s bottom line, given its supply chain reliance on both countries.

**Investors Are Betting on the Vision, Not the Numbers**  
  
Despite rising competition and an aging product lineup, Tesla’s market value has soared post-election, driven by optimism around Musk’s political clout. But reality looms: margins are shrinking, demand is softening, and price wars—especially in China—aren’t letting up. Tesla still holds a dominant position in the EV market, but it needs more than hype to maintain its $1.5 trillion valuation.

**2025, Make or Break for Tesla:** Musk insists Tesla will be “ridiculously good” by 2027, but investors won’t wait that long. The next 12 months will be critical, with cheaper EVs expected to revive demand, and self-driving tech facing regulatory and technological hurdles. For now, Tesla remains a high-stakes bet on Musk’s ability to turn grand visions into reality—and avoid getting lost in his own hype.

# Big Tech’s AI Binge: Meta Bets Big, Microsoft Hits a Wall

**Zuckerberg’s AI Ambitions Hype Up Investors**  
  
Mark Zuckerberg is on a mission to make Meta the AI kingpin. During Meta’s Q4 earnings call, he predicted that 2025 would be the year Meta AI reaches a billion people and that its AI engineering agents would rival mid-level software engineers. Despite a weaker-than-expected Q1 revenue forecast, the stock climbed 4.5% after hours as investors rallied behind Zuck’s AI-fueled optimism. Meta’s ad business remains strong, with Q4 revenue beating expectations at $48.4 billion, even as the company prepares to slash 5% of its workforce to “make space for new hires.”

**Microsoft’s AI Boom Faces a Data Center Bottleneck**  
  
Meanwhile, Microsoft’s AI-powered growth is hitting a roadblock—there simply aren’t enough data centers to keep up with demand. While Azure AI services surged 157%, the company warned that cloud growth would remain sluggish until it expands capacity. That cautious outlook sent Microsoft’s stock down 5% in extended trading, despite Q4 revenue of $69.6 billion, slightly ahead of estimates. CFO Amy Hood reassured investors that the bottleneck should ease by the end of the fiscal year, but Wall Street remains skeptical of its $80 billion AI infrastructure investment.

**The DeepSeek Disruption**  
  
Both Meta and Microsoft are plowing billions into AI, but a Chinese startup just threw a wrench into their plans. DeepSeek’s latest AI model claims to rival the best of U.S. tech at a fraction of the cost, sparking a $1 trillion market wipeout earlier this week. While Meta was spared from the carnage, analysts are questioning whether its $65 billion AI spending spree is visionary or just bloated. Microsoft, already struggling to monetize its AI push, now faces growing pressure to prove that its massive capital outlays will pay off.

**AI Dreams vs. Investor Reality:** Both tech giants are betting their futures on AI, but execution is everything. Meta is using AI to supercharge its ad business and roll out new consumer-facing tools, while Microsoft’s AI dominance hinges on fixing its cloud supply crunch. With investors growing impatient for returns, the real question is whether these AI moonshots will turn into sustainable profits—or just expensive hype.

# 

# Fed Hits the Pause Button

Fed Chair Jerome Powell made it clear: interest rates aren’t going anywhere—for now. While traders were itching for a March rate cut, Powell’s message was more “let’s wait and see” than “get ready for liftoff.” The Fed wants proof inflation is truly under control before it starts easing, with Powell repeating (more than once) that policymakers need to see “serial readings” of cooling prices. Translation? The Fed isn’t convinced yet, and rate cuts might not come until June or later.

**Trump vs. Powell: Round Two?**  
  
If you thought Trump and the Fed’s rocky relationship ended in 2020, think again. The former—and now current—president wasted no time slamming Powell on Truth Social, blaming him for past inflation woes and making it clear he wants rates slashed ASAP. Powell, unfazed, reiterated that the Fed’s decisions are driven by data, not presidential tweets.

**Markets Take a Step Back**  
  
Investors weren’t thrilled. Stocks dipped, Treasury yields popped, and futures traders quickly adjusted expectations, pushing back bets on the first rate cut to June instead of March. While Powell didn’t slam the door on cuts this year, he also didn’t give the markets the green light they were hoping for. With inflation still hovering above the Fed’s 2% target and the economy chugging along, Powell isn’t in a rush to make moves.

**Looking Ahead:** The next big test? Inflation data in the coming months. If price pressures keep cooling, the Fed might start cutting sooner. But if Trump’s policies stir up inflationary headaches, Powell could be forced to keep rates higher for longer. Either way, expect more market drama as the Fed and the White House navigate what’s shaping up to be a bumpy economic ride.

DEEPSEEK:

* OPENAI accuses China's deepseek of using its model for Training:
* OpenAI has found evidence that Chinese AI startup DeepSeek used its proprietary models to train its own open-source model, according to the Financial Times.
* The company says it detected signs of ""distillation""—a technique where developers use outputs from larger models to improve smaller ones, allowing them to achieve similar results at a lower cost.
* OpenAI declined to provide further details but emphasized that its terms prohibit copying its services or using outputs to develop competing models.
* U.S. Navy bans use of DeepSeek due to ‘security and ethical concerns
* Semianalysis, who are one of the best at semiconductor research IMO, corroborate that Deepseek had 10s of thousands of Nvidia GPUs, spending over $500M
* ASML on Deepseek: 
* “For AI to be everywhere, we need to see major progress on costs and power consumption. Lowering costs also leads to more volume...So I will say any technology, whatever it is, that will contribute to cost reduction will increase the opportunity.”

  
Main things to watch in the market:

* Right now, the key thing to watch is the CAPEX number for META and MSFT when they announce earnings tomorrow. If it is massively down from expectations, this will be seen as another selling trigger. Capex guidance in line will be seen as a reiteration that these firms are not massively concerned and will lead to a rip in semiconductors. The 2nd scenario is my base case.

* AAPL - Oppenheimer downgrades AAPL to perform from outperform, lowers FY26 EPS estimate by 4% to $7.95, below consensus of $8.23. Our revision is based on reduced estimates for iPhone sales over the next 12-18 months. Said main headwinds for the company are stronger competition in China, and lack of compelling AI features
* META - CEO Mark Zuckerberg is exploring the purchase of a property in Washington, D.C., according to sources cited by the Financial Times. Notable in implying improved relationship with president.

*  “Our fourth-quarter was a record in terms of revenue, driven by additional upgrades and first revenue recognition of two High NA EUV systems. 2024 overall was another record year, with total net sales of €28.3 billion and gross margin of 51.3%.  Looking ahead, we see Q1 ’25 net sales in the range of €7.5 billion to €8.0 billion, gross margin between 52% and 53%, and full-year sales of €30 billion to €35 billion. AI remains a key growth driver for our industry, though it creates shifting market dynamics among our customers. We’re confident our lithography leadership will continue to serve as a critical enabler for advanced semiconductor roadmaps.”

The tech-heavy Nasdaq jumped 2%, while the S&P 500 added 0.9% and the Dow inched up 0.3%.
* Tech stocks led the recovery, marking their largest two-day turnaround in over two years. Nvidia’s rebound helped lift the sector, while Oracle clawed back 3.6% after Monday’s losses. Despite the optimism, the broader market showed mixed results as investors braced for upcoming mega-cap earnings and the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision.

# Starbucks Brews Up a Turnaround

Starbucks may still be nursing a hangover from its tough 2024, but there’s a glimmer of caffeine-fueled hope. The coffee giant reported a 4% drop in same-store sales for Q1, a smaller decline than Wall Street’s 5.5% expectation and a notable improvement from the previous quarter's 7% slide. Investors were perked up, sending shares up 3% in after-hours trading.

**Reigniting the Roast**  
  
CEO Brian Niccol, just five months into his tenure, has been steaming ahead with his “Back to Starbucks” strategy. From nixing the nondairy milk upcharge to revamping condiment bars and rolling out cozy, customer-centric policies, the company is doubling down on improving the in-store experience. Niccol has even brought in former Taco Bell colleagues to help brew a smoother operational blend.

But it’s not all lattes and smiles yet. Traffic to U.S. stores dropped 8%, and China—a key market—saw same-store sales fall 6% as Starbucks leaned into discounts to compete with budget-friendly rivals like Luckin Coffee.

**Profit vs. Progress**  
  
Starbucks posted $9.4 billion in revenue for the quarter, flat year-over-year but ahead of estimates. Earnings per share hit $0.69, also topping expectations. However, net income took a 23% hit, reflecting investments in Niccol’s turnaround plan and wage hikes for baristas. Operating margins were pinched, but analysts remain optimistic about the long-term payoff.

**A Latte on the Line**  
  
The chain’s overhaul extends beyond the café counter. Starbucks plans to scale back new store openings and renovations in 2025, redirecting funds to fuel its comeback efforts. Layoffs are also on the horizon as the company reshapes its corporate structure for clearer accountability.

Niccol’s bold moves—and Wall Street’s vote of confidence—suggest the turnaround might just have the steam to deliver. For now, Starbucks is walking the fine line between brewing better customer experiences and balancing profitability.

# Novo Nordisk’s Ozempic Gets Green Light for Kidney Disease Treatment

Novo Nordisk’s blockbuster drug, Ozempic, just expanded its resume. The FDA approved the GLP-1 injection to treat chronic kidney disease in adults with Type 2 diabetes, offering a lifeline for millions battling progressive kidney failure and related cardiovascular risks.

**A Lifesaver in a Syringe**  
  
Ozempic has already been a game-changer for diabetes and weight loss, but this approval takes it further. The drug slashed the risk of severe kidney outcomes—think kidney failure or death—from 24% to 29% in trials. For a condition affecting 37 million Americans, that’s huge. Novo’s Chief Medical Officer Stephen Gough called it a breakthrough in addressing diseases that “cluster within the same individuals,” targeting diabetes, obesity, kidney disease, and cardiovascular conditions with a single injection.

**A Competitive Landscape**  
  
This FDA nod strengthens Ozempic’s position as the most broadly approved GLP-1 drug. Novo now faces increased rivalry from Eli Lilly, whose own GLP-1 drugs are making waves, but with this approval, Novo aims to maintain its lead. The decision could also shake up the dialysis market, echoing the phase-three trial’s results that caused kidney dialysis stocks to plummet last year.

**Beyond the Injection:** Ozempic’s approval marks another win for GLP-1 drugs, which are proving their value beyond diabetes. The broader implications—like reducing cardiovascular and kidney risks—could reshape treatment strategies and encourage expanded insurance coverage.

# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

The Federal Reserve kicks off its first meeting of the year, with inflation and interest rates taking center stage. Fed Chair Jerome Powell is set to deliver the verdict tomorrow, and while markets are watching closely, there’s little expectation of a rate cut—current odds stand at a slim 0.5%.  
  
Tomorrow’s after-hours session will bring updates from three tech heavyweights: Tesla, Microsoft, and Meta Platforms. Their numbers are poised to offer fresh insights into how the sector is navigating a volatile market landscape as 2025 gets rolling.

# Before Market Open: 

* The first chipmaker to report earnings since DeepSeek’s AI bombshell, **ASML Holding** has some explaining to do. With analysts eager for updates on capital spending, the real spotlight will be on how tariffs and geopolitical tension are squeezing the company’s margins. Shares have been under pressure, but Wall Street remains optimistic with every analyst covering the stock issuing a “buy” rating. Consensus expectations sit at $6.71 EPS and $9.02 billion in revenue. ($ASML)

# After Market Close: 

* **IBM** may have roots in legacy tech, but it’s been steadily planting seeds in AI, cloud computing, and quantum technology. These forward-looking investments make the company more than just a relic of tech’s past, even if its pace of innovation is deliberate. Add to that a stable dividend that offers a cushion for patient investors, and IBM is quietly making its case as a long-term play. Analysts anticipate $3.79 EPS on $17.6 billion in revenue this quarter. ($IBM)

Daytrading,Portfolios that profited on one of the worst market days of the last 2 years,"Yesterday was one of *those* days. Nvidia lost the value of Argentina’s economy in market cap (ouch), energy stocks tanked, and semiconductors followed Nvidia into the abyss. The NASDAQ dropped \~3%, which isn’t great if you’re holding heavy tech positions.

But here’s the twist: not everyone got crushed. While most portfolios on our platform (85%, to be exact) took a hit yesterday, *15% were up.* Let’s break down what worked for those portfolios and what short-term traders might learn from the chaos:

**What worked yesterday:**

* **Consumer Goods, Healthcare, and Financial Services stocks** led the charge. Some portfolios in these sectors gained 3-5% yesterday alone, proving there’s always action somewhere if you know where to look.
* **“Buy the dip” strategies** pulled through. Traders who snagged companies that had already taken a beating (and avoided chasing tech at its highs) sidestepped much of yesterday’s carnage and caught rebounds instead.

**Key takeaway:** It’s not just about riding the hot hand; it’s about timing your entries and avoiding sectors in freefall. A well-diversified playbook can keep you nimble when markets turn.

For all the hype around tech (NVDA fans, I see you), the *real* money is moving in unexpected places. Let’s talk short-term moves in **2024 performance highlights across industries**:

* **Energy:** GE Vernova up almost 200%
* **Banking:** JPMorgan up 40%+
* **Retail:** Sprouts Farmers Market up 207%
* **Airlines:** United Airlines up 147%+
* **Construction & Industrials:** United States Lime & Minerals up 120%+
* **Healthcare:** Alignment Healthcare up 121%

These aren’t just long-term plays—many of these moves came after sharp corrections or during short-term catalysts. The trick? Catching momentum *before* the herd piles in.

**What to watch next:**

* After a bloodbath like yesterday, watch for oversold bounces (RSI < 30 might be your friend here).
* Keep an eye on sectors like healthcare and consumer goods that showed strength while tech stumbled. Momentum traders may start rotating here.
* News catalysts are king: Earnings season just started, and one good or bad report can shift the entire vibe of a sector.

The bottom line: even when the broader market tanks, there’s always a trade. Whether you’re scalping intraday moves or holding swing positions for a few days, staying flexible and watching for sector rotations can make all the difference.

What were your best (or worst) trades yesterday? Let’s hear it.

# DeepSeek Just Pulled a Fast One on Silicon Valley

What happens when a scrappy startup from China pulls off a David-vs.-Goliath upset? U.S. tech stocks lose a cool $1 trillion, and Nvidia logs the biggest single-day market cap wipeout in history. Enter DeepSeek, the new kid on the AI block, proving you don’t need billion-dollar budgets or cutting-edge chips to shake up the industry.

**AI’s New MVP**  
  
DeepSeek’s latest AI model, R1, developed in just two months for under $6 million, is outperforming its American counterparts in benchmarks. Even more jaw-dropping? The startup used Nvidia’s less-powerful H800 chips—ones deemed “safe” by U.S. export controls. Their secret? An open-source strategy and efficient training methods that make Meta, OpenAI, and Google look like big spenders at an overhyped auction.

**The Fallout**  
  
Nvidia plummeted 17%, losing $589 billion in market cap. Microsoft, Meta, and other tech darlings also tumbled. The Nasdaq 100 sank 3%—its worst drop in six weeks—while energy and infrastructure stocks tied to AI, like Constellation Energy, saw double-digit losses. But some, like Salesforce, could benefit if DeepSeek’s approach makes AI cheaper for end users.

**The Bigger Question**  
  
DeepSeek isn’t just a shock to valuations; it’s a wake-up call for Silicon Valley. With China proving it can play the AI game on a shoestring budget, the days of unquestioned U.S. dominance may be numbered. Nvidia, Meta, and others might want to rethink their big-spending strategies, especially as investors start asking whether the AI boom has gone a little too... bubbly.

**What’s Next?** DeepSeek’s success could rewire the AI race, challenging the notion that throwing money at problems equals better results. But don’t count U.S. tech out yet—earnings reports from Nvidia, Microsoft, and others this week will reveal whether they’ve got what it takes to weather the storm. For now, though, DeepSeek has reminded the giants that every disruptor starts somewhere.

The Federal Reserve kicks off its first meeting of 2025 this week, and despite Trump’s not-so-subtle nudging, don’t hold your breath for any rate cuts. Jerome Powell and his crew are expected to keep the key rate at 4.3%, marking a cautious pause after last year’s three consecutive reductions.

**Why the Pause?**  
  
Inflation is cooling—but not enough. Prices are hovering at 2.4%, just above the Fed’s 2% sweet spot, and the job market remains stubbornly strong, with unemployment at a low 4.1%. For Powell, the challenge is threading the needle: holding rates high enough to keep inflation in check without tipping the economy into a recession. With Trump’s proposed tariffs lurking in the background, inflation risks aren’t exactly taking a back seat.

**Trump vs. The Fed: The Rematch**  
  
Trump has made it clear he’s not a fan of waiting. Last week at Davos, he said he’d “demand” lower rates, calling out Powell by name (again) and claiming he knows interest rates “better than they do.” For now, Powell isn’t taking the bait, but the tension between 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. and the Marriner S. Eccles Building is palpable.

**The Stakes**  
  
Fed officials are divided. Some, like Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee, think inflation will keep easing, justifying future cuts. Others, like Cleveland’s Beth Hammack, argue that the Fed needs to keep rates elevated to fight stubborn price pressures. Add Trump’s tariffs and potential labor market disruptions into the mix, and it’s a recipe for uncertainty.

**What’s Next?** The Fed is signaling a cautious approach, with a “wait and see” stance likely to dominate this week. But don’t expect Trump to stay quiet—he’s already hinted at future clashes with Powell, whose term runs until 2026. Whether rates hold, drop, or—brace yourself—rise, the stage is set for a high-stakes game of monetary policy tug-of-war.

# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

Tomorrow’s lineup is stacked with economic updates: the consumer confidence index, the S&P Case-Shiller home price index, and durable goods orders are all on deck. Plus, the Federal Reserve kicks off its two-day FOMC meeting. While we’ll have to wait until Wednesday for any rate decision, expect plenty of chatter about what Jerome Powell and team are cooking up.

Earnings season stays busy with names like Boeing ($BA), Lockheed Martin ($LMT), General Motors ($GM), Royal Caribbean ($RCL), Kimberly-Clark ($KMB), and Chubb ($CB) taking the stage. JetBlue Airways ($JBLU) will test the airline sector’s hot streak, while Starbucks ($SBUX) looks to reverse three straight quarters of declining sales under its new CEO. Shareholders in both will be watching closely to see if they can deliver—or disappoint.

# Before Market Open:

* **JetBlue Airways** ($JBLU) is flying into turbulence ahead of its earnings report. Despite a banner earnings season for airlines, analysts aren’t feeling optimistic—six say “hold” and four say “sell.” The skepticism centers on JetBlue’s towering debt-to-equity ratio, dwindling cash flow, and mounting operating losses. Investors are crossing their fingers that robust consumer demand and the broader industry’s momentum can carry the airline higher. Expectations are set at -$0.31 EPS on $2.26 billion in revenue.

# After Market Close:

* **Starbucks** ($SBUX) is brewing more than coffee—it’s trying to find its identity under CEO Brian Niccol. With three consecutive quarters of declining sales and sliding customer transactions, shareholders are banking on Niccol to deliver a turnaround. The chain is grappling with balancing its corporate behemoth status with its neighborhood-friendly vibe. Anything short of a rebound could send the stock steeply lower. Analysts are eyeing $0.68 EPS on $9.32 billion in revenue.","['NVDA', 'AAPL', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'META', 'NVDA', 'MSFT', 'META', 'NVDA', 'META', 'NVDA', 'MSFT', 'NVDA', 'NVDA', 'ORCL', 'ORCL', 'ORCL', 'AAPL', 'AAPL', 'AAPL', 'TSLA', 'TSLA', 'BA', 'SBUX', 'SBUX']",1,0,0,2025-01-28 00:06:17+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/1iboclg/stock_market_today_deepseek_just_pulled_a_fast/,0.9743

Daytrading,Consistent trading strategy that has worked for me and netted $300K+ last year.,"**Background**

I’m a 29-year-old, U.S.-based trader with 15 years of experience. My interest in the stock market started young, as my dad was a commodities trader. When I was 14, he let me manage a small Schwab account ($20k, which I know was a privilege). I got hooked, learned through trial and error, and made plenty of mistakes along the way.

I traded throughout high school and college (not well, in hindsight), but lost interest after starting my career in real estate finance. Over time, I focused more on building businesses, most recently a real estate development company.

In 2024, I had a minor liquidity event from another business, which gave me the time and resources to trade semi-full-time again while figuring out my next entrepreneurial move. I’m writing this thread to:

1. Share my journey and what has worked for me.
2. Highlight some key takeaways from my decade+ of trading experience.

**My Strategy**

I’d describe my approach as a hybrid of two styles:

• **Longer-term swing trades**: In high-conviction businesses where both technical and fundamental setups align.

• **Day trades**: Positions fully opened and closed within market hours.

My day trading strategy has remained consistent. It’s a simple, technical, price-focused strategy using a 5-minute chart with two indicators:

• **10-day SMA** (Simple Moving Average).

• **MACD** (Moving Average Convergence Divergence).

**Rules of Engagement**

I trade based on strict criteria:

• Enter long or short when price breaks above or below the **10-day SMA**, confirmed by a bullish or bearish MACD crossover.

• I size up in each trade, scaling out quickly after 1%, 2%, or 3% moves, while letting a portion of the position “run.”

Here’s an example from last week’s $COIN chart. The marked entries show where I entered trades based on these indicators. I stick to price action—no news, no Twitter, no noise. It took me years to trust my strategy and avoid trades that don’t meet my rules, but once I did, the strategy became consistently profitable.

https://preview.redd.it/2fijjooir8fe1.png?width=2330&format=png&auto=webp&s=29c181d318c7954bb1305126f54ebdcb6e0fb275

This method also works on daily, weekly, and monthly charts, which I use for long-term positions when looking for technical entries over extended periods. For example, here’s $COIN on a daily chart.

[\*edit\*, second entry is supposed to read \\""SHORT\\""](https://preview.redd.it/i6jh14glt8fe1.png?width=2310&format=png&auto=webp&s=51c67f487039d17f6c3c2806467002f87fbe8218)

**Execution**

I keep my trades simple:

• I trade the underlying stock rather than options (though options can work if used properly).

• I scale profits quickly—because if you’re not taking profits, someone else is—and let the last 25% ride until it hits a stop at either my entry or the previous day’s lows

**Performance**

I started tracking weekly performance in July 2024. By year’s end, total profits (including swing trades) were **$321,480**. I hope to build on this success in 2025.

**Key Lessons**

Here are some hard-learned lessons from my years of trading:

1. **Avoid earnings trades.** Taking gap risk (overnight price swings) is gambling. Sure, you might win occasionally, but you’ll lose more in the long run.
2. **Focus on a few tickers.** You don’t need to trade everything. Stick to a few liquid names like QQQ, SPY, META, AMZN, TSLA, etc.
3. **Size MATTERS.** How much you make when you’re right and how much you lose when you’re wrong defines your success. Trade a size that feels comfortable and stick with it.
4. **Stick to your strategy.** There’s no one-size-fits-all in trading. Find a method that works for you and stay consistent. The goal is steady profitability.
5. **Don’t overtrade.** If you hit your P&L target for the week, step away. Likewise, if you’re having a bad week, take a break. Survival is key. One bad day or week isn’t the end.
6. **Ignore the noise.** Turn off CNBC. Stick to price action—price doesn’t lie.
7. **Stop listening to everyone who has an opinion**. Find what works for YOU and stick with it. You know what's better than being right? Making money.

**Final Thoughts**

I wrote this quickly, so I’m happy to clarify or answer any questions. I hope sharing my journey and strategy helps others in their trading paths.

**Edit:** here's another beautiful set-up that worked flawlessly with $RGTI last week. Almost 20 points!

For what it's worth, saw some nice bounces off the lows this morning. This sell-off seems very healthy given the relative strength we are seeing in other sectors (i.e., real estate and some software names), as opposed to the full risk-off mode and draining of liquidity which we saw last August with the Yen unwind.","['TWTR', 'META']",3979,547,291,2025-01-26 02:04:19+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/1ia39vf/consistent_trading_strategy_that_has_worked_for/,0.9975

Daytrading,traveling and trading. proxy server/vpn/internet?,"My question is for those who travel and trade and the setup they use when on the go. Here is what I use. So... for my internet I don't have starlink, not yet anyways. Since I don't use greedy apple products, I am able to use a tethering app on my phone to access the internet that's just flying around in the air, for free. Then I adjust the proxy server settings and port address on whichever devices and then I can trade anywhere I have cell phone service. You do have to have an unlimited date plan on your phone which most people have nowadays. For my vpn I've been using Proton VPN and they have been just fine. Since I use a proxy server when on the go, I've noticed certain apps won't work when using a proxy. Think or Swim is one of them. Think or Swim has been kind of difficult from time to time since their takeover of T.D.

I am thinking about getting the starlink ""roam"" plan for around $165 a month. I'm curious who has used it. From the handful of reviews, I have read it seems to work pretty well. I have spoken to several boat owners who have the starlink ""maritime"" system on their boats and they say they can be in the middle of the ocean streaming movies and playing on multiple devices. Who else uses proxy servers, tethering apps, vpns etc... and which ones do you like?

I use all Lenovo devices, laptop, desktop, tablet etc... I like AMD chips. I'm not a gamer so I don't need NVDA. Other than that, I guess that's pretty much my travel setup.

Daytrading,Down 18K! On one trade,"I’m relatively new to the market(6 months) and I’ve been trading Nvidia for the last week or two I thought I had the charts all figured out(me, the expert lol). I would wake up and make 1-2k a day and life was great. So on Friday I took Nvidia calls, almost positive I could replicate my success. I took 80 contracts with almost 80% of my available trading balance. All was going well, I had the opportunity to sell, making 3k for the day. It would have been my biggest win to date. But then I thought….what if I could make more?! And then pain and delusion ensued. The candles befsn began to plummet faster than I’d ever seen. I thought “this isn’t normally how I’ve seen the price behave” but then I also thought “How good would it feel to finish Friday on a win”. I never exited because I was so sure there’d be a bounce. Surely I couldn’t be wrong. I was down to a 50% loss and still my stupidity reigned supreme. I stared at the charts blankly and amazed the way a child stares at the screen when they first discover Roblox or bluey. Price continued to drop, right below the 145 level, a level I thought provided the utmost support. Still I HELD! What a bargain, surely we’ll see a rally at the end of the day I thought. I’m already down 50% maybe i can get a slight movement and sell for only a 20% loss”. 

Looking back I can’t believe I let myself get so greedy. I only have 3k left to trade with now. People have certainly come back from worse but, I really can’t believe my money is gone just like that.  

I’m writing this out in the hopes that 6-9 months from now I can revisit this post and look back at how I’ve grown as a trader. And hopefully it resonates with someone else who’s been here.  And if you happen to be here in the same position if you take anything from my loss, take these three points:  1. You can’t trade like a dumbass and be surprised when you get dumbass results and 2. It’s a painful lesson but It’s not totally the end of the world. 3. It doesn’t matter how good your strategy is if you don’t stick to it.

Bogleheads,A question about organizing different funds,"This is basically a psychological difference so I’ll try to be brief: 

I have these accounts involved: 

Apple Card HYSA 3.9% = Emergency fund/vacation savings/upcoming large expenses

Robinhood = Roth IRA + taxable (majority of my net worth)


Should I move the much smaller HYSA funds into Robinhood? 

Pros: 
- Makes my percentage of growth/loss in Robinhood a more complete financial picture
- One less account
- Slightly higher interest (4.5%)
- Could put some into BND (unless emergency fund is highly recommended to be in cash)


Cons: 

- I may possibly give in to impulse and buy a dip on VTI with some of this money (I have had my account set up this way before and been successful at not doing this)
- Transfers to/from Robinhood are not faster by default, but there is an instant transfer for a fee, which I don’t think Apple has.

Bogleheads,"looking for a Mid-Cap boglehead strategy, avoiding Large Caps for now","Hi,

I've been a lurking Boglehead investor for most of my adult life.    Most of my retirement savings funds are as follows:

* the Federal Thrift Savings Plan (asymmetrically divided between the L2030 and L2040, whose target dates correspond to their names.   L2035 didn't exist when I set this up) 
* a private sector Traditional IRA in Vanguard's VTTHX (target 2035) 
* some Roth IRA funds in Vanguard's VTITX (target 2045) invested more aggressively because that will be the last money that I will spend in my lifetime (or leave to heirs)

All of those investments include trackers which follow the S&P 500 (which implicitly is a mix of Large Cap, Medium Cap, and Small Cap stocks, as I understand it).

In light of recent chaos (in society, but especially with regard to Tesla and NVIDIA), I've been paying attention to articles which suggest divesting from Large Caps from the next few years, in favor of Medium Cap and Small Cap stocks.

But I can't find any Boglehead-friendly index funds which meet those criteria, and which are also the passive Lifecycle investments which I prefer.   I could split some of my investments and place some savings in Medium Cap funds while leaving some as currently invested in Lifecycle funds.   But that would require more hands-on management, which is exactly what I've been trying to avoid.

Bogleheads,"You should ignore the noise regarding tariffs and (geo)politics and just stay the course. But for some, this may be a wake-up call as to why diversification is so important.","It’s been building for weeks but today I woke up to every investing sub on reddit flooded with concerns about what tariffs are going to do to the stock market. Some folks are so worked up that they are indulging fears that this may bring about the collapse of America and/or the global economy and speculating about how they should best respond by repositioning their investments. I don’t want to trivialize the gravity of current events, but that is exactly the kind of fear-based reaction that leads to poor investing outcomes. If you want to debate the merits and consequences of tariff policy, there’s plenty of frothy conversation on r/politics and r/economy. And if you want to ponder the decline of civilization, you can head over to r/economiccollapse or r/preppers. But for seasoned buy & hold index investors, the message is always the same: *tune out the noise and stay the course*. Without even getting into tariffs or geopolitics, here is some timeless wisdom to consider.

**Jack Bogle: “**[**Don’t just do something, stand there!**](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dont-something-just-stand-170445530.html)**”**

Jack Bogle spent much of his life shouting as loud as he could to as many people as would listen that the best course of action for an investor is to buy and hold low-cost total market index funds and leave them alone until they are old enough to retire. It has to be repeated over and over because each time a new scary situation comes along, investors (especially newer ones) have a tendency to panic and want to get their money out of the market. Yet that is likely to be the worst possible decision you could make because [market timing doesn’t work](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Taylor_Larimore%27s_market_timing_quotes#Market_timing_quotes). Pulling some paraphrased nuggets out of The Little Book of Common Sense Investing:

* Most equity fund investors actually get lower returns than the funds they invest in.…. why? Counterproductive market timing and adverse fund selection. Most investors put money in as a fund is rising and pull money out as it is falling. Investors chase past performance.
* Instead, embrace market volatility with patience. Market downturns are inevitable, but reacting to them with panic selling can lead to poor outcomes. Bogle encourages investors to remain calm, keep a long-term view, and remember that volatility is a natural part of investing.

[**Bill Bernstein**](https://rationalreminder.ca/podcast/108https://rationalreminder.ca/podcast/108)**:** “What I tell all engineers is to forget the math you've learned that's useful, devote all your time to now learning the history and the psychology. And one of the things that any stock analyst, any person who runs an analytic firm will tell you, because they really don't want to hire a finance major, they actually want philosophy and English and history majors working for them.”

My impression is that a lot of folks who are getting anxious about their long-term investments in the current climate may not know enough about world history and market history to appreciate the power of this philosophy. The buy & hold strategy works, and that is based on 100 - 150 years of US market data, and 125 - [400 years of global market data](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2911187). What you find over that time is that a globally-diversified equities portfolio consistently delivers 5-8% real returns over the long run (eg 20-30 years). Can you fathom some of the situations that happened in that timeframe that make today’s worries look like a walk in the park?

If you’ll indulge me for a moment to zoom in on one particular period… take a look [at a map of the world in 1910](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/12/World_1910.jpg). The Japanese Empire controls the Pacific while the Russian Empire and Austro-Hungarian Empire control eastern Europe. The Ottoman Empire has most of “Arabia” and Africa is broadly drawn European colonies. In the decades that followed, these maps would be completely re-drawn twice. Russian and Chinese revolutions collapse the governments and cause total losses in markets and Austria-Hungary implodes. Superpowers clash and world capitals are destroyed as north of 100 million people die in subsequent wars in theaters across 6 continents.

The then up-and-coming United States is largely spared from destruction on home soil and would emerge as the dominant world power, but it wasn’t all roses and sunshine for a US investor. Consider:

* There was extreme rationing and able-bodied young men were drafted to war in 1917-18
* The 1919 flu kills 50 million people worldwide
* The stock market booms in the 1920’s and then crashed almost 90 % over the following years
* The US enters the Great Depression and unemployment approaches 25%
* The Dust Bowl ravages America’s crops and causes mass migration
* Hunger and poverty are rampant as folks wait on bread lines
* War breaks out, and again there are drafts and rationing

During this time, prospects could not have looked bleaker. Yet, if you could even survive all this, a global buy & hold investor would have done remarkably fine over 35 years. Interestingly, two of the countries which were largely destroyed by the end of this period - Germany and Japan - would later emerge as two of the strongest economies in the world over the next 35 years while the US had fairly mediocre stock returns.

The late 1960’-70’s in the US was another very bleak time with the Vietnam War (yet another draft), the oil crisis, high unemployment as manufacturing in today’s “Rust Belt” dies off to overseas competitors, and the worst inflation in US history hits. But unfortunately these cycles are to be expected.

>“You need to know these bad things are coming. They will happen. They will hurt. But like blizzards in winter they should never be a surprise. And, unless you panic they won’t matter.

>Market crashes are to be expected. What happened in 2008 was not something unheard of. It has happened before and it will happen again. And again. I’ve been investing for almost 40 years. In that time we’ve had:

* The great recession of 1974-75.
* The massive inflation of the late 1970s & early 1980. Raise your hand if you remember WIN buttons (Whip Inflation Now). Mortgage rates were pushing 20%. You could buy 10-year Treasuries paying 15%+.
* The now infamous 1979 Business Week cover: “The Death of Equities,” which, as it turned out, marked the coming of the greatest bull market of all time.
* The Crash of 1987. Biggest one-day drop in history. Brokers were, literally, on the window ledges and more than a couple took the leap.
* The recession of the early ’90s.
* The Tech Crash of the late ’90s.
* 9/11.

>In 1974 the Dow closed at 616\*. At the end of 2014 it was 17,823\*. Over that 40 year period (January 1975 – January 2015) the S&P 500 (a broader and more telling index) grew at an annualized rate of 11.9%\*\* If you had invested $1,000 then it would have grown to $89,790\*\*\* as 2015 dawned. An impressive result through all those disasters above.  

>All you would have had to do is Toughen up and let it ride. Take a moment and let that sink in. This is the most important point I’ll be making today.

>Everybody makes money when the market is rising. But what determines whether it will make you wealthy or leave you bleeding on the side of the road, is what you do during the times it is collapsing.""

All this said, I do think many investors may be confronting for the first time something they may not have appropriately evaluated before, and that is country risk. As much as folks like to tell stories that the US market is indomitable based on trailing returns, or that owning big multi-national US companies is adequate international diversification, that is not entirely true. If your equity holdings are only US stocks, you are exposing yourself to undue risk that something unpleasant and previously unanticipated happens with the US politically or economically that could cause them to underperform. You also need to consider whether not having any bonds is the right choice for you if haven’t lived through major calamities before.

**Consider Bill Bernstein again**:

>“the biggest psychological flaw, the mistake that people make, is being overconfident. Men are particularly bad at this. Testosterone does wonderful things for muscle mass, but it doesn't do much for judgment. And one of the mistakes that a lot of investors, and particularly men make, is thinking that they're able to tolerate stock market risk. They look at how maybe if they're lucky, they're aware of stock market history and they can see that yes, stocks can have these terrible losses. And they'll say, ""Yeah, I'll see it through and I'll stay the course."" But when the excrement really hits the ventilating system, they lose their discipline. And the analogy that I like to use is a piloting analogy, which is the difference between training for an airplane crash in the simulator and doing it for real. You're going to generally perform much better in a sim than you will when you actually are faced with a real control emergency in an airplane.”

And finally, **the great nispirius from the Bogleheads forum**: while making emotional decisions to re-allocate based on gut reaction to current events is a bad idea, maybe it’s [*A time to EVALUATE your jitters*](https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=79939):

Bogleheads,Is magnificent 7 “eating itself alive”?,"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/28/opinion/nvidia-deepseek-ai-valuation-ouroboros.html

By Mihir A. Desai
Dr. Desai is a professor at Harvard Business School and Harvard Law School.
During Monday’s stock market swoon, Nvidia, the artificial intelligence giant, lost nearly $600 billion in value, the biggest single-day loss for a public company on record. How could the fortunes of one of our leading companies fall so far so suddenly? While some will seek answers in the promising A.I. start-up coming out of China or the vicissitudes of trade policy, these movements speak to deeper changes in our financial markets that can best be explained, oddly enough, by revisiting ancient mythology.

The image of the ouroboros, a serpent eating its own tail, is a remarkably durable and pervasive motif. Ancient Chinese, Egyptian, European and Latin American civilizations seemed captivated by the image or ones like it, variously symbolizing the cyclic nature of life, the totality of the universe or fertility. Today, the more resonant lesson comes from the self-cannibalism of the ouroboros, which helps us understand the most significant financial puzzle of our day.

Like the ouroboros, I believe Big Tech is eating itself alive with its component companies throwing more and more cash at investments in one another that are most likely to generate less and less of a return. Monday’s correction shows that our financial markets — and possibly your retirement portfolio — may be starting to reflect an understanding of this dynamic.

Even after Monday’s dip, the disjunction in valuations between Big Tech — sometimes referred to as the Magnificent 7 of Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Nvidia, Tesla, Meta and Alphabet — and the rest of the stock market remains staggering. The Magnificent 7 still constitute more than 30 percent of the market capitalization of the S&P 500 (up from just under 10 percent a decade ago). When you compare their stock prices with their earnings or sales, the traditional way to measure the valuation of a share, our tech Goliaths trade at ratios that are two to three times those of the Unmagnificent 493.

Market watchers have debated whether Big Tech stocks will continue to outperform everyone else or if shares in other companies will catch up as they use artificial intelligence to become more productive. But the myth of the ouroboros suggests yet another possible outcome.

The first step in understanding this analogy is to return to some finance basics. Stock prices don’t always rise because the prospects of companies improve. They also rise when investors judge certain companies to be a safer bet than others and don’t penalize them for taking longer to generate returns for their money.

While many industry watchers have argued that artificial intelligence will cause the fortunes of the Magnificent 7 to soar, another dynamic is at play: Investors see these companies as a safe bet and have thus stopped demanding significant immediate returns. That’s why the earnings forecasts of stock analysts have not kept pace with the skyrocketing stock prices of these companies.

Why wouldn’t investors expect more for their investment dollars?

I believe global investors have come to see the equities of these seven companies as the premier safe assets. In a world of inflationary spikes, political instability and gridlock and fiscal uncertainty, why not invest in companies with fortress balance sheets, recurring revenue, stable cash flows, commanding market positions and esteemed management teams? It seems a new generation of investors implicitly views these companies almost like governments. Indeed, as evidenced by Tesla’s extraordinary valuation, it’s clear its founder Elon Musk has inspired a loyalty that is akin to a sovereign. In a world of algorithmic trading and passive investing, those beliefs take on a velocity that results in the extremely high prices for Big Tech stocks we see today.

How have the managers of these companies responded to this massive influx of cheap money? Perhaps, precisely as they should have, by pouring more and more capital into investments without worrying about expecting a lot back quickly. From a practical standpoint, what they seem to have done is unleash a remarkable torrent of spending on one another. In other words, they are eating themselves alive.
Nvidia, the much-beloved creator of the next generation of A.I. chips whose stock was crushed on Monday, gets almost half of its revenue from its siblings in the Magnificent 7. In 2022, Google paid Apple $20 billion for the privilege of being the default search engine on Safari, according to unsealed court documents, and therefore very likely accounts for around 20 percent of Apple’s profit. Meta employs Amazon Web Services for cloud services and increasingly in its A.I. push, and all of the tech giants have unleashed an inordinate amount of spending on infrastructure.

And when the tech giants aren’t showering money on one another, they often practice another form of self-cannibalism: purchasing their own shares. In the past three fiscal years, Apple, Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft and Nvidia have bought back a total of over $600 billion of their own stock — a notoriously low-return activity.

There is nothing particularly troubling about the Magnificent 7 purchasing products and services from one another. Nor is there anything necessarily wrong with spending large amounts on capital expenditures or stock buybacks. But if all of these operational and capital allocation decisions are guided by extremely low investor expectations, they may well eventually yield correspondingly low returns. And that gives us a possible glimpse into what lies ahead for the Magnificent 7 and A.I. Rather than a boom that expands still further to a speculative bubble or a rally for the remaining Unmagnificent 493, we may just witness a slow grind of low returns on excessive spending on a technological future that will not be nearly as revolutionary or imminent as promised.

More dangerously, these companies — like all companies — will one day disappoint those who view them as safe assets. And the self-cannibalization will reveal itself to be not just a mediocre investment but also a shaky bet on an illusion propagated by a mythical and messianic belief in technology and these companies.

Similar dynamics have shaped other periods in American history. The remarkable expansion of railroads in the 19th century gave rise to similarly magical thinking; by the early 1900s, after a few decades of frenzied investment, the rail industry made up more than 60 percent of equity market capitalization, and its bonds were considered a safe bet. Their low yields fueled spending on steel and, ultimately, gave rise to the creation of the huge conglomerate U.S. Steel in 1901.
What followed in the first two decades of the 20th century? Remarkably low profits from these companies and mediocre returns from the stock market overall. The natural limits on railroads and entrenched steel players soon became evident, as did the organizational problems that go along with such scale.

Of course, the natural physical bounds that limited the growth of America’s railroads may not exist for today’s Magnificent 7. If artificial intelligence is a truly general purpose technology, then it may well have far greater potential. That said, information technology has been promising such productivity growth for the last two decades without delivering.


One need not look at ancient folklore to find depictions of the ouroboros. The economist Joseph Schumpeter once described capitalism as a process of almost mystical renewal. He admiringly wrote of a cycle of industrial mutation “that incessantly revolutionizes the economic structure from within, incessantly destroying the old one, incessantly creating a new one.” That process of creative destruction sounds just like an ouroboros — but that image is easier to admire and appreciate if it’s not your own tail that’s being eaten.","['NVDA', 'MSFT', 'AAPL', 'AMZN', 'NVDA', 'TSLA', 'META', 'TSLA', 'NVDA', 'AAPL', 'AAPL', 'META', 'AMZN', 'AAPL', 'META', 'MSFT', 'NVDA']",0,7,4,2025-01-29 08:51:35+00:00,https://i.redd.it/xt2h7gdocwfe1.jpeg,0.9995

I told him I just want a “set it and forget it” type. I mentioned wanting just a total world stock index fund, US bond fund, and a global bond fund.

Bogleheads,NEW TO ROTH/ETF Investing,"I’m 48 and I started a Roth IRA for both my wife (40) and I in late 2024. We will fully fund our Roths for 2024 by April 1 and our 2025 by Dec 1. 

Prior to our Roth investments we have heavily invested in our employer plans. My Thrift Savings Plan was maxed out last year and will continue until I retire end of 2037. I intend to start my catchup contributions in 2026 to my maximum ability. And we’re also working towards maximizing my wife’s annual contributions by the end of 2026.

We are both new to ETF investing via our Roth. We have created the below investment strategy. We understand the 3 fund investment strategy, but like the idea of being a bit more diversified and talking advantage of the most that the market could offer but also guarding against drastic changes. Would greatly appreciate any input and feedback.

STOCKS: 60%
VOO - 35% - Diversified Exposure to the S&P 500 Stock Market for all of the big companies.

VT - 10% - Diversified exposure to the world markets. I don’t want to put all of my eggs into only the US Market. 

VB - 10% - Exposure to smaller companies in the US. 

QTUM - 5% - Exposure to growing technology. I don’t wanna look back in 10-20 years and say to myself again, “Damn I wish I would’ve invested a little bit into AI!” (Me now looking at Netflix or NVDA…)

Real Estate: 10%

VNQ - 10% - Real Estate is steady and consistent overtime.

COMMODITIES & BONDS: 30%

GLD - 5% - The world’s most consistent and reliable currency through out the age of time.

BND - 15% - Bonds for portfolio balance and stability 

SHCP - 10% - Bond diversification for portfolio balance and stability.

Bogleheads,Thoughts on this strategy?,"Saw this strategy for someone who is using their HYSA Vanguard Cash Plus along with a brokerage account to pay off bills. are there any cons to doing something like this? are capital gains tax a high concern if you're paying off bills directly with the investment gains? 

Ideal case scenerio:

""-Set my paycheck to direct deposit to Vanguard Cash Plus

\-Invest all cash that comes in VUSXX so I could make the best yields (around 4.3% as of writing) and a portion of it in T-Bills for even better returns.

\-Pay all my daily expenses with a fleet of credit cards (including rent with the Bilt card) that all have the due date set for the 1st of the month with autopay enabled.

\-Then, a few days before the 1st I'll add up the statement balances of all my cards, sell the required amount of shares of VUSXX needed to cover all the statement balances so they go into my Cash Plus settlement fund. The credit cards then receive the payment.

\-This basically nullifies the need to use a bank account, as I'm making the highest rate while also having the convenience of not having to transfer my funds to a different bank to pay bills.

Quick note: The two biggest flaws with this strategy is that Vanguard doesn't have a feature that Fidelity's cash management has, which is the ability to auto-liquidate shares in a money market fund to cover purchases. Like I said, I have to do that part manually a few days before the 1st. I really hope they add this feature one day.

The other flaw is that Vanguard offers no debit card that allows you to deposit/withdraw cash at ATMs. I have mitigated this by having a separate checking account at a bank, putting the minimum amount to waive the monthly fee, and basically using that to send money to and from my Vanguard account any time somebody gives me cash or wants to Zelle me something (could still use Cash Plus with Paypal and Venmo to send and receive money though). I rarely use this account though; it's really just for emergencies.

Aside from those two flaws, this is the best way to keep your banking and investing in one place while also still having the highest possible rate for your cash. For those of you that find this too inconvenient, the best alternative would be a Fidelity money market with their debit card, which can auto-liquidate SPAXX as I've said, and has a debit card which allows you to use it at ATM to withdraw cash (you can't make deposits though). SPAXX is at 4.91% right now so it's not as high as VUSXX, but I'm sure people will find this option more convenient.""",['PYPL'],1,3,3,2025-01-23 22:58:22+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1i8gnkg/thoughts_on_this_strategy/,0.969

I have zero debt, and rent a house for $2000 per month (my share, with a roomate). As a disclaimer, I inherited a little bit of money from a parent who passed away so that bumped my investments up.

- $12,000 in AMZN
- $6,000 in APPL
- $88,000 S&P500 (SWPPX)
- $10,000 VXUS

I don’t currently have interest in buying a house. I’m perfectly happy renting. I live in a city and wouldn’t want to buy here anyways. However, I do plan on wanting to buy a home at some point, probably in my early to mid-30s. So keeping that in mind when it comes to savings outside of retirement accounts.

Buying and selling at ETF, does that affect its price? - It trades like a stock correct? 

Or is it the changes of the underlying stocks themselves that affect the price of the ETF? - Is it not made up of thousands of different stocks that change everyday?

When I purchase 1 share of, say VTI, 6.65% of the holding is made up of Apple. Say after I purchase it, someone sells a huge amount of VTI shares, that would cause the price to decrease correct? Say as that happens Apple's stock price rises dramatically, would that cause the price of VTI to increase?

If you say both are a factor as to determining the price, can you explain how please?

Thank you in advance if you choose to answer this for me! ","['AAPL', 'AAPL']",0,5,5,2025-01-23 12:39:51+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1i82frn/silly_question_about_etfs/,0.9505

Bogleheads,Manufacturing Age vs Digital Age,"So I know everyone says ""back trace"" yada yada, past results are no guarantee of future performance. But I think comparing the market from 50 years ago to today, is like comparing apples to oranges. from 1850-1980 we were a manufacturing-based economy.  Since the dawn of the internet and computers, we are now a digital based economy & outsourced manufacturing to foreign lands for much cheaper labor. So, I don't see how we can compare market activity in the last 50 years to market activity the last 100 years. Comparing the Titans of Industry from 1970 -- GE, Boeing, Raytheon, Xerox -- to Apple, NVidia, Meta, Google, Broadcom doesn't make sense to me.

Bogleheads,Requesting Retirement Portfolio Review for 30-year-old.,"Good evening r/Bogleheads, looking to get some feedback on my current investing portfolios, thesis/overall investing strategy, and if you all have any other recommendations to share. Lots of info below so using a throwaway account, hopefully useful for the reader. Thanks for any advice or feedback you may be willing to share!

Background context:

* Single 30-year-old that started investing at 23 but got really serious about saving starting when I was 25.
* Current U.S. Active Duty (Enlisted E-6) military, 15 years from being eligible for retirement. Not counting on it but don't expect to get out if career plans (aiming to become an Officer within the next 4 years) continue to work out.
* Have 2 major Retirement Vehicles (TSP & Roth IRA) and then 2 smaller taxable brokerage accounts. The Roth IRA has a family group Financial Advisor charging somewhere in the area of a 0.9% AUM fee (get a slight discount due to total family amount under management...) in addition to any individual fees from the funds as far as I understand it. I've worked with the advisor for the past 2 years but haven't been super impressed with his suggestions.
* Maxing TSP (Roth 401k equivalent) and Roth IRA. Roughly at \~37% savings rate of my total income.
* Very healthy 6-month emergency fund sitting in money market mutual fund (VUSXX - Vanguard Treasury Money Market Fund).
* So far in my investing journey been very risk-tolerant (increased investments in both 2020 & 2022)
* Logic orientated and trusts math, so willing to take on higher risk in return for higher returns.

TSP breakdown (\~$95K value):

* 40% C Fund - Equivalent to S&P 500 tracker like VOO.
* 50% S Fund (Dow Jones U.S. Completion Total, DWCPF ticker) - Equivalent to S&P 1000 (i.e. US stock market except S&P 500).
* 10% I Fund (MSCI ACWI IMI ex US ex CHINA ex Hong Kong) - New TSP fund that invests in global developed and emerging markets except for China and Hong Kong.

Roth IRA breakdown (\~$41k value):

* 10% VSMIX - Invesco Small Cap Value Y
* 10% AVUV - Avantis US Small Cap Value ETF
* 12.5% FGSIX - Federated Hermes MDT Mid Cap Growth Fund Institutional Shares
* 12.5% RWK - Invesco S&P Mid Cap 400 RE ETF
* 10% AVLV - Avantis US Large Cap Value ETF
* 5% SMH - VanEck Semiconductor ETF
* 10% IWY - iShares Russell Top 200 Growth ETF
* 7.5% DISV - Dimensional International Small Cap Value ETF
* 7.5% LVHI - Franklin Intl Low Volatility Hi Div ETF
* 5% APDYX - Artisan Developing World Fund Advisor Shares
* 10% QLEIX - AQR Long-Short Equity R6

Brokerage Accounts (\~$22k split evenly between the two):

* Invested mostly in high quality tech stocks that took massive beatings during 2020 & 2022. Companies such as Amazon, Microsoft, ASML, Google, etc...
* I also have a few long shot plays that I put a little bit of money in and have done extremely well; mainly Palantir and RocketLab.
* Mainly just plan to leave these alone and to grow. Once income grows sufficiently enough that I need to contribute to my brokerage accounts regularly I'll start investing in ETFs and Mutual Funds in-line with my investing strategy.

Thesis/Investing Strategy:

* I came across the research done by Fama & French with first their 3 factor and then later 5 factor model and found it very compelling; especially when successive research seems to support the claim that certain factors (in particular size & value) demonstrate out-performance of the broad market with a long enough investment timeline and the capability to withstand the additional risk introduced by the strategy.
* With this in mind I wanted to employ this factor-based style of investment, mostly in my Roth IRA since it is hard to do so in the TSP given the limited options to invest in.
* I also believe given U.S. large cap companies have experienced such outsized growth and performance over the past 15 years that for the next decade small and medium caps will outperform. That being said the largest of the large caps are wonderful businesses and I don't want to completely eliminate my exposure to them.
* I definitely want exposure to international markets given the enticing value being offered by foreign economies; that being said though the U.S. dollar continues to be global reserve currency driving investment into our capital markets as the world continues to become more unstable with Nation State actors such as Russia, China, North Korea, and Iran attempting to dominate their spheres of influence. Thus, limiting the percentage amount of what I feel comfortable setting in my portfolio to invest outside the U.S.
* I understand fees are absolutely vital to take into account for the long-term performance of my investments; that being said I am willing to pay a higher expense ratio if in order to do so I am investing in an etf or fund that fits my desired investing strategy.
* Overall, across all my investments I have exposure to roughly \~95% equities and then with QLEIX I have \~5% exposure to some alternatives.
* Other things I've identified include: 60-40 ratio of small/mid to large cap, \~85-10-5 breakdown of US to international to alternatives, heavy value tilt across all capitalization and regions.

Started to ramble a bit there at the end but that's the full write up. Happy to answer any clarifying questions anyone may have. Looking forward to seeing the responses, hopefully there will be lots of good discussion.","['AMZN', 'MSFT']",2,3,3,2025-01-20 03:54:17+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1i5hhfy/requesting_retirement_portfolio_review_for/,0.9973
Bogleheads,Rate my Portfolio,"Hello! I've been researching about stock investment since a long time but only have just started putting my money in recently. I'm using Trading212 platform and wanted some redditors opinions on my portfolio.

#  Portfolio:

||
||
|Portfolio|%|
|US Stocks|65% (75% HLAL, 25% SPUS)|
|International (EU) Stocks|20%|
|Gold|10%|
|Individual stocks|5%|
|total|100% |

Here's the thought process behind it:  
I'm 27 just about to turn 28 this month and can put $500 into my portfolio each month. Since I'm not 30 yet I'm adopting a slightly aggressive strategy where I'm 85% into stocks. Since I'm muslim, I can't directly invest into ETFs such as VOO and SPY as they contain companies which are non-compliant with Shariah law, similarly I can't invest in bonds so I can't follow the Boglehead 3-fund portfolio to a T. But this is what I've come up after weeks of research.  
  
US Stocks:

I'm investing 65% into US stocks where 75% of this is going to go into HLAL. I would go all in and invest the whole US Stocks portion just into HLAL but it does not contain some BIG S&P 500 companies like Nvidia, Amazon, Eli Lilly so I've made a separate pie of the stocks which are not in HLAL and allotted a weighted % so it is in line with the percentages of the holdings in HLAL.

International EU Stocks:

Following Bogleheads philosophy, the next portion of my portfolio is for the purpose of international exposure which will increase my portfolio diversity. I'm investing 20% into an ETF called HIEU. It contains some big companies such as Novo Nordisk, SAP etc and has returned 9% in the last year. The ETF is pretty diversified with no sector going above 25%.

Gold:

I'm investing 10% into SGLD which is a gold etf. Since I can't invest directly into bonds, my solution to protect against inflation is to go a small portion into gold. We've been seeing a bullish trend in gold recently and over the last year SGLD has returned 35%.

Individual Stocks:  
  
I wanted to keep a small portion of my monthly $500 investment into individual stocks. I will mostly be conducting my own market analysis and 5% ($25) is money I can play around and would not lose my sleep even if it were to go down by a drastic level.

 

What do you think? I'm open to any suggestions. ","['NVDA', 'AMZN']",0,2,2,2025-01-19 10:22:53+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1i4vk0h/rate_my_portfolio/,0.9679

She has a pretty low risk tolerance, has separate savings from this portfolio and won't need the money for at least 10 years, and has a separate portfolio solely consisting of US treasury bonds.

What do you think of this split? Do you see any glaring issues here? I'm thinking the tech-heavy nature of this might not be great. I also wanted to add a consumer staples fund in here somehow.
